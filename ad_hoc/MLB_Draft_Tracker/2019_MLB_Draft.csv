Then there are players like Rutschman, who has somehow managed to surpass expectations during his junior season at Oregon State after helping the Beavers win the College World Series and earning CWS Most Outstanding Player honors in the process. He capped things off by being a member of USA Baseball's National Collegiate Team over the summer and has kept on rolling on both sides of the ball this spring. The switch-hitting backstop is the complete package at and behind the plate. He has an advanced approach at the plate, walking more than he's struck out at Oregon State, with the ability to make consistent, hard contact and drive the ball from both sides of the plate. He'd been more of a gap-to-gap doubles hitter, but the over-the-fence power started to show up more during his junior season. Rutschman is also outstanding behind the plate, with excellent hands, agility and a very strong throwing arm. He's even a better runner than some give him credit for. With his all-around skills at a premium position while playing at the pinnacle of college baseball, Rutschman will be at the forefront of all conversations for the top pick in the Draft. The last time the Orioles took a switch-hitting college backstop with their first pick, Matt Wieters, it worked out pretty well."

His son could go even higher in the Draft in 2019, as he's the consensus top prep prospect available. He performed well at several prominent 2018 events, winning the High School Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game and claiming MVP honors at the Under Armour All-America Game, the States Play Series and the 18-and-under Pan American Championships in Panama. A rare potential five-tool shortstop, Witt didn't always make consistent contact on the showcase circuit last summer but scouts aren't worried about his bat. The right-handed hitter shows good barrel control and some willingness to use the entire field, so he could hit for average if he modifies his aggressive approach. His raw power and speed are both plus tools, which, combined with his baserunning instincts, could make him a 20-20 player. Witt covers plenty of ground at shortstop, has quick hands and possesses the arm strength to make all the necessary throws -- as well as pump mid-90s fastballs from the mound. His love for the game is evident, and scouts praise his makeup as much as his physical ability. He'll turn 19 shortly after the 2019 Draft, making him old for his class and sophomore-eligible in '21 in the unlikely event he follows through on his commitment to Oklahoma."

He was PAC-12 Freshman of the Year in his first season, then hit .402 with 23 homers in 2018 to win the Golden Spikes Award as an underclassman, a rare feat. He's continued to hit during his Draft season, putting him in position to be one of the first players chosen in the first round. Vaughn could very well be the best all-around hitter in this Draft class. He has a very advanced approach at the plate, one that has allowed him to walk much more than he has struck out throughout his Cal career, with a knack for barreling up the baseball. He doesn't sacrifice power as a result, showing the ability to hit the ball out to all fields, profiling as a true middle-of-the-order run producer in the future. He's a first baseman only, though he thinks he could handle third or the outfield, but should be fine at first, with decent hands and a solid arm that allowed him to pitch as a freshman. After a relatively ordinary summer with USA Baseball, Vaughn got back to mashing baseballs during his final college season. He is very much in the conversation at the very top of the Draft as a college hitter who should be able to move quickly through a system."

He made up for lost time by starring in the Cape Cod League, where scouts voted him the top prospect in the prestigious summer circuit. He has had a breakout junior season in terms of power, vying for the NCAA Division I home run lead, and could be the first college outfielder selected in June. Vanderbilt has had three outfielders drafted in the top three rounds in the last four years (Jeren Kendall, Bryan Reynolds, Rhett Wiseman), and Bleday is a better bet to produce at the plate than all of them. One of the best pure hitters in the college ranks, he has a quick left-handed swing, controls the strike zone well and hammers line drives to all fields. He has started to translate the bat speed, strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame into at least solid power, beginning with slamming more homers with wood bats on the Cape (five) than he did with metal for the Commodores (four) in 2018. A two-way player in high school who showcased an upper-80s fastball on the mound, Bleday has a plus arm that fits well in right field. Though he's a below-average runner, he covers enough ground to serve as a competent defender. His instincts help make up for his lack of quickness on the bases and in the outfield."

He capped it off by leading USA Baseball's 18 and Under National Team in RBIs as it won gold in the Pan-American Championships. He's done nothing to harm his status this spring. There is no one who doubts Greene will hit at the next level. The left-handed hitter has a terrific approach at the plate with a smooth swing. It's more of a line-drive approach right now, but he did start driving the ball more over the summer and he'll show excellent power in batting practice, especially to the pull side. Greene has been more athletic and has been moving better this spring, both down the line and in the outfield. He still profiles best as a corner outfielder, which might mean left field because of a less-than-average arm. How early Greene goes in the first round could depend on which team most firmly believes the power will emerge. Seeing the Florida Gators commit come off the board in the top half of the first round is a very reasonable outcome."

Abrams' speed and athleticism compare favorably to any of the top prep talents in the 2019 Draft, and he's also one of the better high school hitters available. He draws comparisons to Dee Gordon, though he has considerably more pop than the former batting and stolen-base champ. Abrams has game-changing speed, uses his quickness to beat out bunts and grounders and has the instincts to develop into a premium basestealer. He has a quick left-handed stroke and controls the bat very well, making consistent contact and using the entire field. While he won't be a slugger, he has looked a little more physical this spring and has the bat speed and deceptive strength to hit 10-15 homers on an annual basis. The biggest question with Abrams is where he'll eventually make his defensive home. The Alabama recruit has solid arm strength and a chance to stick at shortstop, but he doesn't have the most fluid actions. He might fit better at second base or center field, and he played the latter position in deference to Bobby Witt Jr. on Team USA at the 18-and-under Pan American Championships in Panama last fall."

He immediately stepped into Texas Christian's rotation as a freshman but was somewhat of an enigma in his first two college seasons because his performances were more respectable than dominant. After showing more consistency and confidence this spring, he could be the first college pitcher drafted and beat out Lance Broadway (No. 15 overall in 2005) as the highest pick in Horned Frogs history. Lodolo usually works at 90-94 mph and peaks at 96 with sink on his fastball, using his 6-foot-6 frame to deliver it on a steep downhill plane. He showed inconsistent feel for spinning a curveball in the past and is focusing instead on a tighter slider in the low 80s that has become a solid offering. He also sells his changeup well and it has good action at the plate, giving him three pitches that all can grade as plus at their best. Lodolo has a long, lean body that could add more strength and an easy delivery. He's doing a better job of maintaining his three-quarters arm slot, resulting in improved control and command. He's also pitching with more confidence, attacking hitters and realizing the potential Pittsburgh saw in him three years ago."

He encored by topping the league in hitting (.392), on-base percentage (.491) and RBIs (80) while leading the Red Raiders to the College World Series as sophomore, then had a strong summer with Team USA. One of the more well-rounded offensive players in the college ranks, he should join Donald Harris as the only first-round picks in Tech history. Jung has a controlled approach at the plate, repeatedly barreling balls to all fields with a sound right-handed swing. He lets his power come naturally and his bat speed and strength should translate into 25 or more homers per year once he turns on more pitches, which he hasn't done with much frequency this spring. He manages the strike zone very well and has no shortcomings in his offensive game. Though Jung is a below-average runner, he's reasonably athletic and makes enough plays at third base. He has the strong arm required at the hot corner and should be able to stay there. His instincts help him make up for his lack of quickness in the field -- the Red Raiders moved him to shortstop in mid-April -- and on the bases."

Langeliers' defense alone could make him a first-rounder. Recovering from hitting .252 as a sophomore, he has looked better offensively this spring despite breaking the hamate in his left hand and rushing back after just three weeks. Langeliers has a cannon arm that can produce 1.7-second pop times in workouts and 1.8-second clockings during games, and he used it to erase 70 percent of basestealers as sophomore. The 2018 Rawlings/ABCA Gold Glove recipient as the best defensive catcher in college baseball, he's a quality receiver who's more agile and athletic than most at his position. He also has the strong leadership skills teams desire in a backstop. Even when Langeliers slumped last year, he still made consistent contact and doesn't have any glaring flaws in his right-handed stroke. It was more a matter of trying to do too much at the plate rather than letting his solid to plus raw power play without selling out for home runs. He's a below-average runner but quicker than a typical catcher."

For his first two years, Bishop showed glimpses of tools, but with the same issues that plagued him as a prepster. His junior year, however, has been a revelation, and he's put himself near the top of the college bats eligible to be drafted. Bishop's transformation came soon after he returned from his stint in the Cape Cod League, showing a new stance and rhythm at the plate during fall ball he has stuck with since. The left-handed hitter has always had tremendous raw power, but there have been questions about his ability to hit enough to tap into it. There will be some swing and miss, but he's shown bat speed, strength and loft consistently, with majestic home run power to his pull side, but also the ability to drive the ball to all fields. He runs very well for his size, regularly recording plus times down the line. That speed works in center field, with many scouts thinking he can stick there, even though this is the first time he's played there full-time. The only negative at all with Bishop now is a lack of a track record of success. His ability to stick to his gameplan consistently this season, to go along with his natural tools, has nearly everyone believing it's for real, lining him up for an early first-round selection."

He's been that pitcher ever since, moving his way to close to the top of college arm options in this year's Draft. A physical beast at 6-foot-6, 260-pounds, Manoah has always shown glimpses of solid power stuff, but without consistency or command of it. That's changed this spring as he has shown above-average control for most of his junior season. He's pitched with a fastball typically in the 94-97 mph range, missing a ton of bats thanks to good sink. His slider flashes plus at times and has been a more reliable weapon for him. He has a solid changeup, relying on it in the Cape Cod championship game, but he hasn't used it as much this spring. Manoah has managed to keep his large frame in sync and has repeated his delivery in order to fill up the strike zone more effectively. Given that he doesn't have that many starts on his resume, he's a rare college pitcher with projection, something that should get him off the board in the first round, much earlier than his older brother Erik, currently a reliever in the Angels system, who was drafted by the Mets in the 13th round of the 2014 Draft."

They're built similarly, they rank among the best all-around hitters in their respective high school and college classes and they still have to convince evaluators that they can stick at the hot corner. Baty may have passed Jung with a more impressive spring and his bat could land him in the middle of the first round. Baty possesses some of the best raw power in the 2019 Draft, the product of bat speed, strength and loft in his left-handed swing. He's also more of an advanced hitter than just a pure masher. A Texas recruit who would be eligible for the 2021 Draft as a sophomore, he makes repeated hard contact, isn't fooled by breaking pitches and doesn't get caught selling out for power. Though he clocks below-average running times, Baty is a better athlete than his lack of speed might indicate. He played basketball at Lake Travis High (Austin) and could remain a third baseman if he improves his agility and maintains the conditioning on his big frame. There's no question about his arm because he has registered fastballs up to 92 mph off the mound."

Thanks to a breakout fall and a consistently solid spring, Cavaco has popped up to be the next from Eastlake to likely go in the early stages of the Draft. Cavaco first started getting attention for his complete tools package at the Angel Elite showcase in the fall, where his tremendous raw power particularly stood out. The only question about his offensive profile is how consistently he'll hit to get to that power, as there is some swing and miss to his game. Beyond the bat, Cavaco will show flashes of plus tools across the board. He's clocked sub four-second times home to first out of the box and he has the chance to be a plus defender at third, with very good hands, footwork, a plus arm and a willingness to stick his nose in the dirt. The industry was sleeping on Cavaco, who wasn't invited to most of the summer showcase circuit events, so there is a lack of track record and the infielder hasn't been challenged against tough competition like some have.

That's why Stott, who looks and plays a lot like Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford, was high on lists entering this spring. The UNLV product has continued to perform as a junior, cementing his status as a potential top 10 pick. Nearly all of Stott's tools grade out as at least above-average. He has the chance to be a plus hitter, with very advanced bat to ball skills. He's never overmatched and always seems comfortable in the box, handling good velocity and offspeed stuff equally well, while walking more than he's struck out in his college career. Even when he's off-balance, he keeps his hands back and shoots the ball the other way to left field. And while he'll never sell out his hit tool for power, he'll show pop in batting practice and it's easy to dream on 15-18 homers annually at the next level. While Stott does show off a plus arm at times, the one area there's a split camp might be his ability to play shortstop in the big leagues. Most give him a chance to stick there, given his makeup and instincts, unless the team he's on has a better defender on the roster.

He was one of four players to hit 10 or more homers in Atlantic Coast Conference games in 2018, joining Giants No. 2 overall pick Joey Bart, Astros first-rounder Seth Beer and Blue Jays second-rounder Griffin Conine. Though he's not physically imposing, Wilson has quick hands and deceptive strength that give him at least above-average raw power. A right-handed hitter, he has a knack for putting the barrel on the ball. He shows the ability to hit for average and power, and he has done a better job of drawing walks this spring despite his aggressive approach. The biggest knock on Wilson is his below-average speed. Most big league shortstops run better than that, though some scouts think he can stay at the position because he has quick actions and hands. Others believe his speed and average arm will land him at second base, where he played as a freshman and still would profile well offensively."

That perception changes once you see the Pacific Northwest high schooler play. Carroll hit at pretty much every stop on the summer showcase circuit last year, establishing himself as one of the top prep bats in the country. He's done nothing to diminish those evaluations this spring. Carroll has one of the best overall approaches in the Draft, especially among high school hitters. He can spray the ball to all fields from the left side of the plate, but as he did most noticeably during his Perfect Game All-American Classic MVP performance, he can drive the ball with line-drive loft and surprising pop. His outstanding speed helps him on both sides of the ball, with the ability to steal bases and play an outstanding defensive center field. The UCLA commit has drawn comparisons to hitters like Jacoby Ellsbury and Andrew Benintendi, slightly undersized left-handed hitters who grew into their power at the next level.

He intrigued scouts enough to go in the first five rounds as a Missouri high schooler in 2017, but his strong commitment to Arkansas left him undrafted. He pitched just 15 2/3 innings as a freshman for the Razorbacks and was left off their postseason roster, prompting his decision to transfer to San Jacinto. Rutledge pitches at 94-97 mph and reaches 99 with his fastball, showing the ability to carry premium velocity into the late innings. While his heater has riding life at the top of the strike zone and sink toward the bottom, its movement isn't as consistent as its velocity. His upper-80s slider can be a wipeout pitch with depth and his low-80s curveball can be a plus offering with 12-6 break when at their best, though they aren't always reliable weapons and can play closer to average. With his huge 6-foot-8 frame, Rutledge creates difficult angle on his pitches that make them even harder to hit. His biggest needs are to improve a changeup that can get too firm and flat, and to refine his control and command.

Scouts love Priester's athleticism and the ease of his arm action. His four-seam fastball can reach 97 mph with riding life, though his heavy two-seamer in the low 90s may be even more effective because it gets exceptional horizontal and vertical movement. He also owns one of the better curveballs in the 2019 prep class, sitting around 80 mph with tight spin and good depth. Priester hasn't had much need for a changeup to this point and will need to achieve greater velocity separation from his fastball, but his athleticism and intelligence should help him develop it into an effective third pitch.

He still would have landed a well over-slot bonus from Tampa Bay if he hadn't failed a post-Draft physical, and more medical questions arose when he missed two months as a sophomore with an elbow injury that didn't require surgery. He has stayed healthy and done a much better job of throwing strikes in 2019, putting himself in position to be one of the first pitchers drafted. As a southpaw with a strong frame and four pitches, Thompson has the ingredients to become a mid-rotation starter. Both his fastball, which sits in the low 90s and tops out at 96 mph with some run and angle, and his low-80s slider are plus pitches at their best. He generates good spin rates on both his slider and curveball, which has more depth than power, and also mixes in a decent changeup. Though some clubs still have concerns about Thompson's health history, he has helped his cause by not missing a start and working deeper into games this spring. His high-three-quarters delivery is relatively clean, and he's finally pounding the strike zone after battling it in his first two college seasons.

That distinction belongs to Kirby, who capped a breakout sophomore year by posting a 24-1 K-BB ratio in 13 innings as a Cape Cod League reliever. He has followed up by leading D-I in strikeout-to-walk ratio for much of his junior season. Kirby has four potential quality pitches to make it as a starter, beginning with a running fastball that sits in the low 90s, reaches 98 mph and should add more velocity as he gets stronger. He has feel for spinning the ball and both his curveball and slider show flashes of becoming plus offerings. He also has some aptitude for throwing a changeup with some sink. Kirby has so much success with his fastball that he hasn't relied as much on his secondary pitches, which still need more consistency. He doesn't have any problems throwing strikes but will have to refine his command. He has a sound delivery and arm action, so it's easy to project him as a possible No. 3 starter."

Of the half-dozen college players at that position who have legitimate first-round aspirations in 2019, he might be the best pure hitter. His outstanding hand-eye coordination allows Shewmake to put the bat on the ball with ease. A left-handed hitter who's a bit unorthodox at the plate, he tends to get caught out on his front foot but still has the dexterity to slap singles to the opposite field. He also has the bat speed and leverage in his still-projectable 6-foot-4 frame to turn on balls, hinting at average power in his future. Shewmake grew up around the game because his father Shane is the head coach at Texas-Dallas, and his instincts are apparent on the bases and in the field. He has a knack for stealing bases despite average speed and makes plays at shortstop. His arm is more accurate than strong, leading some scouts to project him as a second baseman, and he has the versatility and selflessness to fit anywhere in the infield."

To go that high, he'll have to answer questions about his instincts and effort that date back to high school. Jones has true top-of-the-scale speed and basestealing acumen. He creates havoc when he gets on base and is doing a better job of doing so in 2019, making more consistent contact while posting one of the higher walk rates in NCAA Division I. A switch-hitter with some bat speed and strength, he shows average raw power from both sides of the plate during batting practice but has yet to translate it into home run production. Though Jones has solid arm strength to go with his blazing speed, there's skepticism about his ability to remain at shortstop. He doesn't react as quickly as expected at short and doesn't throw well from different angles. Many scouts project him to wind up in center field, where his tools would fit well."

Good success in two years of starting with the Bruins had him poised to be one of the better college bats to be considered in June and while a slow start to his junior season impacted his stock, he was getting hot as the spring wore on. Toglia is a solid athlete, especially given his 6-foot-5 frame that he's still growing into. And as a kid from the Northwest, he's still growing into the game. He's shown huge raw power from both sides of the plate, with some scouts putting a 70 on his raw power, but there are some questions about his ability to make enough contact to tap into it consistently. He wasn't comfortable in the box at the start of the season, but the streaky hitter was starting to put it together. Athletic enough to handle an outfield corner, he's a plus defender at first who can save runs at the infield corner.

He repeatedly reached the upper 90s on the showcase circuit last summer and broke Hunter Greene's Under Armour All-America Game record with a fastball clocked at 99 mph. Espino usually works at 94-97 mph and has reached triple digits with his fastball. He can overpower hitters with sheer velocity, gets good riding action on his four-seamer and can show heavy sink on a two-seamer. Opponents can't afford to sit on his heater because he has a pair of power breaking pitches, with his sharp low-80s slider currently grading better than his upper-70s curveball with good depth. Espino dabbles with a changeup that gets too firm but flashes good sink at times. The Louisiana State recruit's control and command are inconsistent, in part because he has a long arm action, so some scouts project him more as a reliever than as a starter. There's not a lot of projection remaining in his frame, which is smaller than his listed height and weight, but his present stuff already is plenty good."

He tied a Tulane record with three homers in his fifth game of the 2019 season and has kept up the rampage, homering seven times in his first seven contests in April. Tulane's best offensive prospect since 2003 Indians first-rounder Michael Aubrey, Hoese is loaded with natural right-handed power. He's always had a good swing and the ability to leverage the ball with his 6-foot-4 frame, and he has taken off since getting stronger. He drives the ball in the air from gap to gap with ease, maintaining a disciplined approach that has led to more homers and walks than strikeouts in 2019. Though he's a below-average runner, Hoese moves well for his size and covers enough ground to remain at third base. His solid arm strength adds to his quality profile at the hot corner, a package that should land him in the top two rounds."

His future definitely is in baseball, however, as he's the best prospect from New Hanover since the Red Sox made Trot Nixon the seventh overall choice in the 1993 Draft. Scouts don't have a lot of history with Walston and his projectability is more attractive than his present stuff, but he could fit in the top two rounds if he's signable away from North Carolina State, where he'd concentrate solely on baseball. He's a quality athlete with a good arm action and delivery, fills the strike zone and still has the room to add 40-50 pounds to his lanky 6-foot-4 frame. If he goes to college, gets stronger and develops as expected, he could be one of the first players selected in the 2022 Draft. Walston has shown glimpses of what he can become by working with a riding 90-93 mph fastball early in some games, but he'll also sit in the upper 80s at times and dip to 85 mph late in contests. He has natural feel for spinning the ball and has promising depth on his curveball, though it currently parks in the low 70s.

Both were starters in college and made it to the big leagues as relievers, a path Jensen could very well take after pitching well as Frenso State's Friday night starter this spring. Jensen has arm strength to spare, with a fastball that sits from 94-98 mph. He's able to maintain his velocity deep into his starts, showing plenty of 97-98 mph heaters in the seventh and eighth inning of his starts. When he finds his arm slot, it can have plus life, but he often loses it, causing it to be flat and very hittable. His slider will show flashes of being an above-average pitch, but it's not consistent. He does have an upper-80s changeup with some fade that might be average, but he doesn't use it much. Jensen has a tendency to over stride at times, which makes it tougher for him to repeat his delivery and command the baseball. With some effort to his delivery and an undersized frame, many see Jensen moving to the bullpen, with his power stuff playing up and allowing him to move more quickly.

He has been a totally different pitcher since he returned and could go as high as the second round this June after turning down the D-backs as a 26th-rounder last year as a redshirt sophomore. While many pitchers see their velocity increase after they complete the grueling rehab process after having their elbow reconstructed, Small doesn't throw as hard as he did in the past but is much more effective. His fastball ranges from 86-92 mph yet generates a lot of swings and misses and weak contact. He creates plane with his 6-foot-3 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot and deception with some crossfire and by varying the tempo of his delivery. Small also demonstrates significantly better feel for his changeup than he had before he got hurt, selling it with fastball arm speed and getting some fade on the mid-70s offering. He has a curveball with similar velocity and good depth, though he rarely uses it in games because he hasn't needed to.

Much like former Clemson star Seth Beer, an Astros first-rounder in 2018, Davidson has confounded evaluators with the dichotomy between his success with metal bats (.921 OPS, 38 homers in two-plus years with the Tigers) and struggles with wood (.570 OPS, three homers in two summers in the Cape Cod League). If scouts were convinced that Davidson will hit with wood, he'd likely be the first college shortstop drafted in June. A switch-hitter, he has some timing issues and a swing that tends to get long, leading to strikeouts. His strength and leverage already generate plus raw power, and he should have more as he fills out his lanky 6-foot-3 frame. There are no holes in the rest of Davidson's game.

Volpe is the kind of player who grows on evaluators the more they see him, with his whole being greater than the sum of his parts. He gets an 80 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale for his makeup and work ethic. He does have a solid approach at the plate with excellent bat control and while he doesn't have a ton of power, there is enough strength to keep pitchers honest, like when he went deep at the NHSI. Though he's not a burner, Volpe runs well and has good instincts on the bases and defensively. He has good hands and footwork and while he might have an average arm, some feel it might mean that second base will be a better long-term home for him, even if a team sends him out as a shortstop initially. Because of his track record for performing well against good competition and his makeup, it might be wrong to bet against Volpe. Whether a team is willing to draft him early enough to sign him away from his commitment to Vanderbilt, where he could continue being teammates with Leiter if neither signs, remains to be seen."

He has improved in each of his three seasons at North Carolina and also has starred in the Cape Cod League. Busch makes it look easy at the plate. He has a smooth left-handed swing with plenty of bat speed and a patient, balanced approach that allows him to hammer balls to all fields. He should hit for average and power while drawing plenty of walks, and few college players in this Draft have a higher offensive ceiling or floor. Busch's Draft status is compromised somewhat by uncertainty about his future home. He's small for a first baseman and has below-average to fringy speed and arm strength. He's more athletic than his 6-foot, 207-pound frame might indicate -- he starred in football and hockey as well as baseball in high school -- and possibly could handle second base (where he played on the Cape) or left field (where he has seen action this spring)."

He has plus raw power and the improvements he's shown as an overall hitter make some feel it might eventually play as plus in games in the future. Coming into the spring, he was thought to be a below-average hitter, but there is more confidence it will continue to play better than that. There is some swing and miss, but nothing concerning, and he's shown an improved ability to handle quality arms this spring. While he's an easily below-average runner, he's more athletic than you'd think, runs decently and can even handle playing a corner infield spot. His arm strength shows closer to 70 at times and he's gotten better with his overall receiving.

The North Carolina native who moved to IMG for his senior year of high school has the makings of four solid pitches and improved consistency in using them throughout a start. He regularly runs his fastball up to 96 mph and has shown an ability to maintain that velocity deeper into starts this spring. He now features two distinct breaking pitches, with a plus slider a big reason for his step forward. It's a true out pitch and it's better than his average curve, which is a bigger 11-to-5 breaker when he maintains his high three-quarter arm slot. He has feel for his changeup, though he can slow his arm a bit on it at times. After starting the spring looking like the thrower he was over the summer, he's made strides towards being a more complete pitcher with improved command.

He backs up his heat with a pair of hard breaking balls, a curveball with depth and a slider with more lateral break, and each can be a plus pitch at times. Jameson also has a changeup, though it's a bit firm and he doesn't use if very often. Though he has dominated as a full-time starter this spring, scouts worry that he's not big enough to handle the grind of taking the mound every five days in pro ball.

Now it's his brother's turn and while scouts were a little more bullish on Mike, Sammy's performance at events like the Tournament of Stars and East Coast Pro Showcase put him firmly on the radar. Siani's standout tool is his left-handed bat. The outfielder has an outstanding and smooth swing and showed the ability to make consistent contact against some of the better prep arms in the country. He's hit over power with a good approach at the plate, but some might be light on his power because of his smallish frame. Siani does get into trouble at times chasing first pitches out of the zone too often. He might not be the plus defender his brother is, but he could a capable left fielder with a solid average arm. It's not always easy to get good looks at cold-weather high school players, so teams thinking about taking him in the top two rounds and signing him away from his Duke commitment might be doing so based on his strong summer performances.

He not only throws strikes, but he'll also use any pitch in any count and work inside against left-handers and right-handers.

He led Conference USA in homers in each of his first two seasons, totaling 35, putting him in position to become the first first-rounder in Golden Eagles history. He hasn't been as consistent at the plate or with his effort this spring, however, so he's more likely to go in the second or third round. Wallner's size, strength and aggressive left-handed stroke combine to give him some of the best raw pop in the 2019 college class. He needs to prove he can handle quality velocity and may have to tone down his approach a bit, as he'll chase pitches out of the zone rather than let his prodigious power come naturally. He still draws a healthy amount of walks because pitchers are loathe to challenge him. Primarily a center fielder in his first two years at Southern Miss, Wallner has below-average speed and moved to right field this spring. He definitely has the arm strength for right, reaching 97 mph with his fastball and complementing it with a hard slider and splitter as a reliever. Some scouts have more interest in him as a pitcher, though he hasn't taken the mound as a junior after straining his forearm in February and has made clear his desire to play regularly in pro ball."

He spent his first two college seasons at Louisburg (N.C.) JC as a light-hitting shortstop and worked just six innings on the mound as a sophomore. After transferring to Campbell, he has showcased two potential plus pitches and what one scouting director called the best delivery in the 2019 Draft. Johnson has an effortless arm action and delivery, looking very natural on the mound despite his inexperience. The ball comes out of his hand so easily, with his fastball topping out at 98 mph and usually ranging from 91-95. His slider is his best secondary offering, a plus pitch in the mid-80s at its best but also still inconsistent. As would be expected for a newcomer to the mound, Johnson still needs polish. His loopy curveball and his changeup are less reliable than his slider but can become at least average pitches with more experience. He hasn't dominated so-so competition in the Big South Conference, in part because his control and command need work, but he has the athleticism to make the needed adjustments."

But he quickly won a starting job as a Baylor freshman and has continually improved during his three years in Waco. As one of the better hitters in the 2019 college crop and having a chance to have average or better tools across the board, he could go as early as the second round a year after the Red Sox selected him in the 37th round as a Draft-eligible sophomore. Wendzel is fearless at the plate, willing to work deep counts while he hunts for a pitch to hit and taking walks when he doesn't get one. He stays inside the ball well with his right-handed swing and uses the entire field. He tends to drive the ball to the gaps and could tap into more of his solid strength and raw power once he turns on more pitches. A well below-average runner when he got to Baylor, Wendzel has worked hard to develop close to average speed out of the batter's box and plays quicker than that with good instincts on the bases. He shows some twitchy actions at third base, where his arm and defense earn solid to plus grades.

Rated as a potential top-three-rounds pick entering 2019, he has boosted his stock as he has shown more strength and quickness as a senior. He's Auburn's top recruit but unlikely to make it college and join his older brother Jackson on the Tigers. One of the better hitters in this year's high school class, Henderson produces a lot of hard contact from gap to gap. He has shown more bat speed from the left side of the plate this spring and his power is catching up to his hitting ability as he continues to add muscle to his 6-foot-3 frame. He has been a little faster this year as well, more consistently recording above-average run times. There's still some debate as to where Henderson will wind up defensively. Those who think he can remain at shortstop believe he's an underrated athlete with a quick first step and a plus arm. Others believe he'll slow down as he fills out and necessitate a move to third base, where he'd still profile well offensively."

He has improved throughout his three years of college at Arizona and earned all-star honors in the Cape Cod League last summer. While his floor is more impressive than his ceiling, it may be enough to get him selected in the top three rounds. Cannon's best attribute is his ability to make repeated line-drive contact from the right side of the plate. He controls the strike zone well and has grown into some gap power, ranking among the NCAA Division I leaders in doubles this spring. He's an average runner out of the batter's box and a little quicker once he gets going, though he's not much of a basestealer. Cannon has played both middle-infield positions for the Wildcats and spent most of his Cape summer at third base. He has reliable hands and is best suited for second base because his average arm is a bit stretched on the left side of the infield.

That, plus his commitment to the University of Florida, led to him getting drafted in the 33rd round of the 2017 Draft. Two years later, as a Draft-eligible sophomore, McConnell's stock was on the rise as a consistent college hitter after missing most of his freshman season with injury. McConnell's offensive profile stands out the most. The 6-foot-3 infielder has the chance to hit at the next level with a knack for barreling up the baseball that's been on display all spring. He's added strength to his wiry frame, and he's showing more ability to drive the ball, with the chance for future average power. A good athlete and plus runner, McConnell can steal a base as well. The jury is out whether he can stick at shortstop in the long-term. Some see a move to second base, but those who think his actions and hands are what's holding him back think he'd be best off in center field, where his athleticism would play well.

Thompson announced his presence by reaching 95 mph as a rising junior at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in 2017 and remains one of the hardest throwers in this year's prep class, though he has lacked consistency this spring. Thompson has an ultra-quick arm and an athletic delivery that produces low-90s fastballs with a maximum velocity of 96 mph when he's at his best, though he also has worked at 89-90 at times this year. His fastball doesn't feature a lot of life but he gets good plane on it with his high three-quarters arm slot. His curveball can give him a second plus pitch at times, though it hasn't been reliable this spring as it had been in the past and flattens into more of a slider when he doesn't stay on top of it. Though Thompson's changeup is in the rudimentary stages, he'll flash promising deception and sink. He also needs to refine his control and command to reach his upside as a No. 3 starter.

If he convinces pro teams he can produce at the plate, they probably won't let him make it to college. A fast-twitch athlete, Nunez has Gold Glove upside at shortstop and is a slam dunk to stay at the position. He has smooth actions, quick hands and feet and the arm to make any throw from any angle. In the event that he doesn't hit enough to be an everyday player in the big leagues, he has the tools to play anywhere on the diamond in a utility role. Because Nunez is one of the smallest premium prospects in the Draft at 5-foot-9 and 155 pounds, he comes with concerns about how much impact he'll have at the plate.

Matijevic, who both were taken in the top four rounds of their respective Drafts. Offensively, it's Quintana's raw power that is his carrying tool. It shows up in games in flashes and he has the ability to hit the ball with authority the other way, to right-center field, but he gets pull happy at times. That leads to some swing and miss and streakiness, but if he can stay with his strengths, he could be an average hitter and tap into that power more consistently. A shortstop in high school, Quintana moved over to the hot corner in college and has become a plus defender there. While the one knock against him is his pure foot speed, he has good first-step quickness at third, with confident hands, a plus arm when he needs it and the ability to make plays on the run.

Big, strong and physical, he has tremendous raw power that allows him to launch balls a long way. The rest of his game is a bit raw, though he does show some feel to hit and isn't just a kid trying to pull everything out of the park. While he's not a speedster, he runs pretty well for his size. He makes good and accurate throws from the outfield with his average arm, and he's a capable defender, though he needs to polish his reads and routes. A calm, quiet kid, he gets high marks for his makeup. Mears is the kind of high school player scouts can dream on, with the potential to be a run-producing right fielder, in a Nelson Cruz kind of mold, when all is said and done.

Hinds has performed well on big stages, including Major League Baseball's High School Home Run Derby during All-Star Weekend. It's not just batting practice power, as Hinds did hit two homers during his stint at the Tournament of Stars. But with that power came a lot of swing and miss, with scouts worrying about his pitch recognition, particularly his ability to pick up spin. Ideally, Hinds will be able to stick at third, where his power bat would profile well, and he does have enough arm for the spot, though the jury is still out whether he can man the hot corner long-term, with him better at quick reactive plays while he struggles when he has time to worry about his footwork. He has seen some time in the outfield, but that hasn't gone well. One scout compared Hinds defensively to Phillies prospect Alec Bohm, who was the No. 3 overall pick in last year's Draft.

With four solid pitches at his disposal, Garcia fits the profile as a future starting pitcher. While his fastball sits in the 90-93 mph range, he gets swings and misses on the pitch thanks to good deception and riding life with solid spin rates. His slider will flash plus, a power breaking ball he throws 83-86 mph with good two-plane break. He also has feel for an excellent changeup, and while his curve is clearly his fourth pitch right now, it is distinct from his slider and he'll throw it with good depth at times. Garcia fills up the strike zone and could have future plus command. While he's not the biggest guy in the world, there is a history for guys throwing a bit harder once they leave UCLA and enter the pro game.

He encored with a solid summer in the Cape Cod League, which he led with 29 walks in 40 games, and has matched his sophomore numbers this spring. Wyatt is reminiscent of McKay as an offensive player. He's a left-handed hitter with plus raw power but focuses more on making consistent contact and getting on base. He has tremendous feel for hitting, manages the strike zone very well and could develop at least 20-homer power on an annual basis if he gets more aggressive and drives more balls in the air.

At 6-foot-6, Williams is the quintessential projectable high school right-hander. While he started the spring a bit slowly velocity-wise, at 87-91 mph, it's been ticking up, sitting 91-92 mph and regularly touching 94 mph, as he did throughout his NHSI shutout in March. It plays up because of its steep plane and angle and there should be more consistent velocity to come as he matures. He's been throwing both a slider and curve this spring, with success, with some scouts thinking the curve will ultimately work better coming from his high three-quarter slot. He has some feel for a future average changeup, though he doesn't have to throw it much in high school. Despite his size, Williams tends to throw strikes and should have solid command and control, not to mention sharper stuff, once he figures out how to consistently repeat his delivery with his long levers.

Wolf has gotten noticeably stronger, adding at least 10 pounds to his 6-foot-2 frame, and dropped his arm slot from high three-quarters to three-quarters. Those changes have increased the velocity and movement on his fastball, which previously sat around 90 mph but has ranged from 90-97 with armside run all spring. His curveball can overmatch hitters as well, residing in the low 80s with 12-6 break when he stays on top of it.

Though Fletcher makes loud contact when he connects at the plate, there are questions about his hitting ability and how well his raw power will translate into production. He has a big leg kick that he'll need to tone down and he may have to rework his right-handed swing. He must refine his reads and jumps to get the most out of his speed on the bases and in the outfield."

A 36th-round choice by the Brewers last June, he didn't pitch in the fall while recovering from surgery to repair the labrum in both of his hips, then performed well at two heavily scouted tournaments at the beginning of this season. He hasn't been as consistent since but still offers enough upside to factor in the top three rounds. When he's at his best, Williamson can operate at 91-94 mph and reach 96 with his fastball, which plays up with late life and downhill plane, and backs it up with a mid-80s slider. At other times, he'll work around 90 mph with his heater and lose velocity and sharpness on his slider. He can achieve good depth on his curveball and some tumble on his changeup, though the latter offering can get too firm. Williamson has the athleticism and easy arm action to throw strikes but sometimes battles his control and command. His 6-foot-5 frame not only creates difficult angle but also has projection remaining. He has considerable untapped potential and could become a mid-rotation starter if he figures everything out."

So the Beavers went back to the Sacramento, Calif., area, a region that had brought them standouts like Nick Madrigal and Andrew Susac in the past, to find Philip, a junior college transfer from San Joaquin Junior College. Philip has had a solid season as Oregon State's leadoff hitter, though a hamstring injury kept him off the field for a stretch this spring. With a strong and sturdy build, Philip is an athletic shortstop who should be able to stay at the position. He has good hands and more than enough arm for the spot and his speed, which also gives him some basestealing ability and helps him in terms of range. At the plate, he's shown the ability to make hard contact with good bat speed. He has gap power to all fields and can drive the ball very well the opposite way. While his hamstring issue slowed him temporarily, he was back to full strength as the Draft approached. Getting looks at him healthy as the Beavers hit postseason play could be important for his Draft stock as missing time hurt him as a JUCO transfer without a long track record. His combination of tools at a premium position could be a very nice find in the top six rounds."

He spent his freshman year as a swingman, winning the game that sent the Aggies to the College World Series, and has been one of the Southeastern Conference's best starters the past two seasons. He outdueled 2018 No. 1 overall pick Casey Mize at the '18 SEC tournament and could become A&M's highest pick since Tyler Naquin and Michael Wacha went in the top 19 selections seven years ago. Doxakis has effort in his delivery and uses an arm slot that varies from low- to mid-three-quarters, yet that doesn't prevent him from pounding the strike zone with three pitches. He doesn't dazzle radar guns with his 88-93 mph fastball, but it plays up because of its armside run and his ability to command it to both sides of the plate. He masterfully manipulates his low-80s slider, changing velocities and shape and demonstrating the ability to back-foot it against right-handers. Though Doxakis' changeup is less reliable than his other two offerings, it features some fade and shows flashes of becoming a solid third pitch. Some scouts look at the stress with which he throws and peg him as a reliever, and he did hit 97 mph as a freshman in that role, but he has the three-pitch repertoire, control and durable frame to start and the makeup to get the most out of his ability."

Though he ranks among the NCAA Division I saves leaders thanks to an 88-92 mph fastball and an effective slider, pro teams want him solely as a position player. He was three days too young to qualify as an age-eligible sophomore for the 2018 Draft, where he might have gone in first 10 rounds, and has boosted his stock this spring to where he could go as high as the third. Schunk makes consistent line-drive contact from the right side of the plate and has improved offensively in each of his three seasons with the Bulldogs. He has the strength and bat speed to hit for more power, and he shows at least solid raw pop in batting practice, but he'll probably top out at 12-15 homers per year unless he adds more loft to his swing. He puts the bat on the ball so easily that he rarely walks, another adjustment he'll have to make at the next level. Schunk has fringy speed out of the batter's box but a quicker first step that helps make him at least a solid defender at third base. He also has soft hands and a strong arm, though he needs to improve his defensive consistency. If everything comes together, he could be a .270 hitter with 20 homers who's an asset at the hot corner."

Valdes had stood out previously because of his defensive acumen, but some added strength has made him more of a legitimate prospect as the Draft approached, with his name creeping into Day 1 conversations. There's no question Valdes' calling card is his defense. He'll be able to play shortstop long-term with good hands, a cannon for an arm and the ability to throw from all angles. Like with many young shortstops, he'll make the flashy plays and then lose focus on others at times, though no one doubts he'll gain consistency as he matures. The big question around Valdes is his bat. He's trying to switch-hit currently, with his left side behind his right, and though he's added good weight, a lack of strength concerns some as his bat tends to trail through the zone leading to an opposite-field based approach. A lack of true defensive shortstops in this class has no doubt helped Valdes, who has reminded some of a Luis Guillorme type, shine by comparison. A team taking him early, and signing him away from his commitment to Florida State, will be one that sees enough future strength gains to allow his bat to catch enough for him to be a glove-first everyday shortstop at the big league level."

Lewis didn't play shortstop until 2017 because he was blocked by Strumpf. Strumpf has since moved to second base at UCLA and, coming off a huge sophomore season that saw him lead the Bruins in a host of offensive categories, started slowly in his junior season but was starting to show the advanced bat that scouts saw the year prior as the Draft approached. It's Strumpf's hit tool that stands out. He can flat out rake with excellent strike zone discipline, showing the ability to barrel up the baseball consistently. While he doesn't have huge raw power, there's some definite thump from the right side of the plate and he can punish mistakes. While he was a shortstop in high school, he doesn't have the arm or speed to play there, but he should be a reliable defender at second base. It's the bat, though, that will get him drafted in the early rounds of the 2019 Draft. He profiles as an offensive-minded second baseman with some power, kind of like a right-handed version of Bruin product Kevin Kramer, who made his big league debut with the Pirates in 2018."

He chose instead to attend Wabash Valley (Ill.) CC, where he has averaged more than two strikeouts per inning for a club ranked No. 1 in the juco ranks for most of the season. He may have the biggest gap between his ceiling and floor of any player in the Draft. His fastball topped out in the low 90s as a high school senior, but after adding 20 pounds and cleaning up his delivery, Kelly is reaching 98 mph and showing the ability to work at 94-97 mph for innings at a time. Scouts look at his 6-foot-6 frame and how easy and loose his arm looks while pumping mid-90s heat, and many of them come up with same physical comparison: a young David Price. He still has room to add more strength and to further improve his mechanics, so it's easy to project him topping 100 mph in the future. Kelly lacks a usable second pitch because he hasn't shown much aptitude for spinning the ball -- his mid-80s slider is below average -- and his changeup is non-existent. His control also needs a major upgrade and his mound presence concerns scouts as well. His development will require a ton of patience and he ultimately may be more of a reliever than a starter, but he has a rare arm."

He has performed capably for three years with the Tar Heels, though he never has dominated as much as hoped. He ascended to the front of UNC's rotation this year but got knocked around in Atlantic Coast Conference play. Baum can display four pitches that earn solid or better grades at their best. As a starter, he works at 90-92 mph and reaches 94 with his fastball, creating some armside run with some crossfire in his delivery. He uses his high-three-quarters arm slot to stay on top of an upper-70s curveball that is often his best pitch, and he also can manipulate it into a harder, more lateral-breaking slider in the low 80s. Baum also has at least an average changeup with some fade and is doing a much better job of throwing strikes in 2019, enhancing his chances of remaining a starter in pro ball. He has a high floor as a potential No. 4 starter with a fallback of becoming at least a seventh-inning reliever. He has reached 97 mph with his fastball coming out of the bullpen and could have a more consistent plus curveball in shorter stints."

Those plans went awry, however, as a stress reaction in a lumbar vertebra limited him to just six games and forced him to miss summer ball as well. He has returned this season and been the Tigers' best hitter, playing his way into the top three rounds of the Draft. Smith makes repeated contact from the left side of the plate, using the entire field and controlling the strike zone. He has solid raw power and drives the ball consistently enough to provide 15 or more homers per season. He has solid to plus speed and the savvy to use it well on the bases. Smith also shows good instincts in the field, giving him a chance to stay at shortstop even if many scouts project him to shift to second base at the big league level.

His grandfather Don was an All-American for the Rebels in baseball and basketball before playing in six All-Star Games with the Cubs, and his father, Kevin and uncle Keith (another big leaguer) also played for Ole Miss. Scouts appreciated Grae's steady play but were underwhelmed by his package of tools -- though now they're reconsidering him after he hit .405 in Southeastern Conference play as a junior. Kessinger was a career .248 hitter before league play began this spring, but as one evaluator said, ""You don't hit .400 in the SEC by accident."" He has a history of making contact with a controlled right-handed swing and line-drive approach, and he has hit the ball harder than ever in 2019. He draws walks and plays quicker on the bases than his below-average speed out of the box, though he has modest home run power at best. Kessinger makes plays at shortstop despite lacking classic tools for the position. He's not twitchy or flashy and his arm is merely average, yet he compensates with instincts and positioning. He likely will move to second base in pro ball and may be more of a utilityman than a regular, though his strong makeup and surprising junior season may foreshadow him exceeding expectations."

While Lugo may not go quite as high as that duo, the middle infielder who raised his profile with a strong showing on the summer showcase circuit does have the chance to go in the Draft's first few rounds. Lugo's bat is what has stood out the most, especially over the summer and at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October. He has an advanced approach at the plate, especially given his age, with a line-drive, up-the-middle philosophy. While he's not nearly as big as Correa, Lugo looks the part already and has more pop from the right side of the plate than you might expect, with some feeling he could have better than average power in the future. While he's not a burner, he runs well underway and is a solid athlete. The Carlos Beltran Academy product gets some mixed reviews defensively. Some see a move to third or second, depending on where the bat would profile best, but others feel he can stay at shortstop and just needs to smooth some things out.

After a nondescript freshman year, spent almost entirely in relief, Marsh took a nice step forward as a sophomore with the Sun Devils. He then threw well during a brief stint in the Cape Cod League last summer and that has carried over to his junior season, where he has raised his profile as ASU's Friday night starter. Marsh has four pitches, all of which he can throw for strikes. While he'll typically sit around 92 mph, he can get his fastball up to 96 mph consistently and throws his heater with solid cut and sink. His slider, thrown 78-83 mph, is better than his curve, thrown with more power and with the ability to land it in the strike zone and then out of the zone to get hitters to chase. He has feel for a changeup as well. In addition to having four pitches which could all be Major League average when all is said and done, scouts love the way Marsh competes on the mound. Some see a slightly better version than area standout Jake Wong, a third-round pick of the Giants out of Grand Canyon in 2018, with a bit better command and the potential to be a No. 4 starter at the highest level."

He raised his profile even more by showing he could put up similar numbers with wood bats, finishing fifth in the Cape Cod League in batting average and tied for fourth in home runs. While he hasn't replicated that success during his junior season, he was coming on a bit stronger to climb out of his early-season funk. Stowers' power is legitimate, with the ability to drive the ball to all fields with good bat speed, and he showed enough ability to make contact to hit .326 in the Cape over the summer. There is length in his left-handed swing, however, leading to some swing and miss issues at times, including 34 strikeouts in 34 Cape League games. A solid athlete who runs well enough, Stowers has largely stuck to the outfield corners in college though he was seeing time in center field this spring, with most seeing left field as his likely long-term home. Power is always a hot commodity, especially from a college left-handed hitter. Stowers is streaky, but his bat speed and natural leverage should entice some teams who covet pop in the early rounds."

He projects to go in the top four or five rounds and perhaps even higher to a club that believes it can unlock more power. Triolo has a prettier swing than most right-handers and uses it to make consistent contact while controlling the strike zone. He has strength and leverage in his impressive 6-foot-3 frame, but his bat speed is merely average and has limited his power production. Unless he can quicken his stroke and perhaps add more loft, he may max out at 30-35 doubles and 15 homers per season at the next level.

The most successful from that group was catcher Chris Widger, who spent parts of 10 years in the big leagues after being a third-round pick in 1992. A fellow Patriots backstop, Driscoll hopes to follow in Widger's footsteps, though it's unlikely he'll hear his name as early in the Draft. Driscoll has a solid track record with the bat at George Mason, hitting well over .300 in each of his three seasons as a starter, though he did appear over-matched against quality pitching in the Cape Cod League last summer. For most of his college career, he's shown outstanding contact and on-base skills, drawing as many walks as strikeouts. Early on this spring, he was selling out on his swing trying to get to his power, but went back to his contact-first approach from the left side of the plate and got back to staying through the ball more effectively. Driscoll also runs very well for a catcher, even stealing some bases along the way. His best defensive tool is his above-average arm and while he is an acceptable receiver, he does need to work on his setup behind the plate. There's a dearth of catching, especially in the college ranks, in this year's class, which will certainly help Driscoll's status.

But his velocity and performance began to decline in late March, leaving scouts unsure what to make of him. When he was going great, Henry commanded all three of his pitches well. He operated at 91-92 mph and peaked at 94 with high spin rates on his fastball. He got swings and misses with a changeup with fade and a slider with depth, both of which arrived in the low 80s. Henry generated a bunch of ugly swings when he was on top of his game but hasn't since his fastball dipped into the upper 80s and his secondary pitches haven't been as sharp.

As with his older brother David, an infielder with the Angels, his skills still stand out more than his pure physical ability, but those skills and his track record of production could get him drafted in the top three rounds. Fletcher's best attribute is his play in center field. Though he's a fringy runner out of the batter's box, he's quicker once he gets going and has tremendous instincts that allow him to track down balls from gap to gap. He has displayed plus arm strength in the past, though it has played closer to average in 2019. Fletcher has a power-based approach at the plate, and his strength and aggressive, pull-conscious mentality could produce 15-20 homers per season. He doesn't have the smoothest left-handed swing and he's a streaky hitter, but he makes consistent contact and should hit for a decent average.

Like he did a year ago, Campbell is operating at 91-95 mph with his fastball, which has reached 98 and plays up thanks to the steep downhill plane he creates with his 6-foot-4 frame and high-three-quarters delivery. The biggest difference from 2018 is that he now can land his secondary pitches for strikes on a regular basis, so hitters can't just sit on his heater if he falls behind in the count. His second-best weapon is a low-80s slider that sometimes morphs into a mid-80s cutter. Campbell has scrapped a changeup he didn't trust for a mid-80s splitter that shows flashes of giving him a third solid offering. He also has an upper-70s curveball that he can get over for strikes to give batters a different look.

He should join teammate Tommy Henry to give the Wolverines two pitchers taken in the top five rounds of the same Draft for the first time since 1994 (Heath Murray to the Padres in the third round, Ray Ricken to the Yankees in the fifth). Kauffmann owns one of the livelier fastballs in the college ranks, usually operating at 91-94 mph, topping out at 96 and holding his velocity deep into games. Its running and sinking action mirrors that of his solid changeup, which he sells well and has good separation from his heater. His slider ranges from 81-86 mph and can be an above-average pitch at times, though it lacks the consistency of his other two offerings. While Kauffmann has some effort in his delivery, he repeats it well and doesn't have any difficulty throwing strikes. He has a relatively high floor as a three-pitch starter with a track record of performance. His ability to generate ground balls will make him useful as a reliever if he can't cut it in a pro rotation."

His father Jim, also a right-hander, went in the second round of the 1991 Draft to the Astros before topping out in Triple-A, and Jimmy could go in the same range. He also offers intriguing hitting ability and some power potential, but teams are scouting him exclusively as a pitcher. Lewis still has plenty of room to add strength to his 6-foot-6 frame and he already can reach 95 mph with his fastball and carry low-90s velocity deep into games. He uses his size and a high-three-quarters arm slot to deliver his pitches on a steep downhill plane. Those attributes also help him stay on top of an upper-70s curveball with good depth than can become a plus pitch once it's more consistent. Lewis also demonstrates some feel for a changeup but will have to use it more often against more advanced hitters. He has a fairly simple delivery for such a tall pitcher, and his strength and athleticism bode well for his control and durability. He's part of a banner Louisiana State recruiting class but becoming less likely to make it to Baton Rouge."

He hasn't shown quite the same power since but has posted identical stat lines in each of his three years of college while impressing with his speed and defense. After dropping to the Red Sox in the 40th round amid signability concerns as a sophomore-eligible, he'll go in the first five rounds this June. Watson's best pure tool is his well above-average speed. His quickness and instincts allow him to steal bases and chase down balls all over center field, where he has a playable if fringy arm. His defensive ability is reminiscent of that of former LSU star Andrew Stevenson, who has seen big league time with the Nationals. Watson's offensive game draws more mixed reviews from scouts. He has surprising bat speed and sneaky power for a speedster who's not physically imposing, though he gets caught up swinging for the fences too often. He'll need to make some adjustments to his right-handed stroke and improve his pitch recognition and plate discipline to handle more advanced pitching."

But the big right-hander returned in late May no worse for the wear and displaying an intriguing array of starting pitching stuff. The 6-foot-4 Gambrell is big with arm strength to spare and has a three-pitch mix that points to a future in a rotation. He'll be 91-95 mph with his fastball, sitting around 93 mph in most starts. It plays up a bit with riding life and occasional sink to his armside down in the zone. He uses his solid average slider a lot, throwing it with good three-quarter angle with curveball-like depth to it. His low 80s changeup gives him a third Major League average offering, and he sells it well with good arm speed. Gambrell's strike-throwing ability has improved over each of his three years with the Beavers, but it's more control over command at this point.

This spring, he has taken a step forward and flashed enough stuff that he could go in the top two rounds. After sitting in the upper 80s with his fastball in the past, Dalquist now operates at 91-93 mph and reaches 95 with the promise of more velocity to come. He uses four-seamers up in the strike zone and two-seamers down at the bottom, with his extension creating deception that stands out more than the life on his heater. He gets good depth on his mid-70s curveball, which should become a consistently solid offering once he adds some more power. Dalquist also has a slider and changeup that he hasn't used much.

His twin brother Luc plays first base for the Volunteers and could get drafted in June, though he has been sidelined since fouling a ball off his foot and fracturing it in March. Lipcius has good hand-eye coordination and controls the strike zone extremely well, allowing him to make consistent contact throughout his time at Tennessee. He has turned his right-handed stroke loose more often as he has gotten more comfortable against college competition, yet he has continued to walk nearly as much as he has struck out while producing more power. He's a well below-average runner who can clock some bottom-of-the-scale times down the line when he takes a big swing. Though he lacks quickness, Lipcius has good reactions at third base and should be at least an adequate defender with more experience there. His reliable hands and solid arm strength fit at the hot corner, as does his offensive profile.

Whitehouse (Texas) High outfielder Mason House rode a similar path to a third-round selection by the Padres in 2017, and Head could land in similar territory. Head has some arm bar in his left-handed swing, though he overcomes it with advanced feel for hitting. Wiry strong with good snap in his wrists, he has above-average bat speed and raw power. While his offensive potential is impressive, he has little track record against quality competition. If Head continues to develop and improve, he could wind up with solid or better tools across the board.

A member of USA Baseball's 18-and-Under National team that took home a gold medal at the Pan American Championships in Panama, Callihan started this spring a little slowly, but his bat was coming on as his senior season wore on. Strong and stocky, Callihan has shown an innate ability to barrel up the baseball, both at a number of elite-level events over the summer, as well as this spring, with an advanced approach from the left side of the plate. He has legitimate raw power he's already tapping into and hit two home runs, along with a .528 average during Team USA's gold medal run. He's a better athlete than you might think, though he is a below-average runner. The big question surrounding Callihan is where he'll fit defensively. He does have the chance to stick at third, with enough arm and the bat to profile there, though some worry about his range. Callihan did get some work behind the plate, including catching some innings in the Pan Am Games, but scouts aren't sure that will work long-term. Some see an Eric Chavez-type at third, with less range defensively, and it's the bat that will get the South Carolina commit off the board early on Draft day."

Most evaluations on Brown are projections for far off in the future, with interested teams knowing they will have to be patient. He does have solid contact skills from the right side of the plate and he should grow into some raw power. He needs to add strength and has trouble impacting the ball at times as a result, though some scouts point out that Brown was most heavily scouted while facing pro competition this spring. The Texas A&M commit has close to top-of-the-scale speed, which makes him a threat on the basepaths and helps him cover a ton of ground in center field, where he should be a plus defender down the road.

Big, strong and physical, Allan has seen all of his stuff play up during his senior season. His four-seam fastball continues to touch 97 mph on a regular basis and he's maintained that velocity deep into starts, showing that it wasn't just the shorter stints of the showcase circuit that allowed him air it out. He'll drive the ball down in the zone, but can pitch up and down with his fastball well, with improved overall command of the pitch both in and out of the strike zone. He complements the heater with a plus power curve he can throw for strikes, missing bats consistently. His changeup has also taken a step forward, giving him a third at least above-average pitch. While some scouts don't love Allan's arm action in the back, it doesn't affect him out front and he's commanded all three of his pitches extremely well, repeating his delivery consistently.

Baylor shows flashes of all five tools, though he doesn't always consistently show them all at the same time. He didn't impact the ball that much on the summer showcase circuit, but scouts think his right-handed swing works and there should be average future power.

An excellent athlete, Baylor runs well and is aggressive on the basepaths. He's raw at shortstop, and he'll need to work on his angles and footwork, but might have the chance to stick there, thanks to decent hands, his athleticism and a strong arm that has been up to 92 mph on the mound.

If he follows through on his commitment to Virginia, he could develop into a first-rounder in the 2022 Draft. Kochanowicz has an 89-93 mph fastball that tops out at 95 with riding life up in the strike zone. His 6-foot-6 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot provide plenty of downhill plane, and his size also creates extension that adds to the quality of his fastball package. He has high spin rates and good depth on his mid-70s curveball, which could be a hammer once he gains more velocity.

Mostly about power, Locey hasn't shown much of a changeup. He's strong and physical, though to remain a starter he'll have to do a better job of repeating his delivery and commanding his pitches.

His best secondary pitch is his changeup, which he sells well and throws with run and sink at times. At its best, it has downward rotation and fade to it and he can throw it to both sides of the plate. His slider is solid-average and he can land it for strikes, getting swings and misses with it against Patriot League hitters. In the past, his curveball has been a better weapon for him than it has been this year, though he has shown the ability to throw all four offerings for strikes. The main concern about Stoudt is his size. The 6-foot-1 right-hander isn't extremely physical and while he does have some strength in his lower half, he does need to add more strength to offset worries about his durability over the course of a long pro season.

He used that as a springboard to become one of the best college closers in the nation and make a run at the school's single-season saves record. Wallace is the prototypical power short reliever and his stuff will play at the next level. He'll throw both a two-seam and four-seam fastball, the former thrown 92-94 mph with good sink and the latter sitting 95-98 mph consistently.

Coming out of the bullpen, McAvene sits at 93-95 mph and can reach 96 with riding life on his four-seam fastball. He's doing a better job of generating velocity without overthrowing this spring, helping his ability to pound the bottom of the strike zone. He backs it up with a low-80s breaking ball that combines slider power with curveball depth. Both of McAvene's pitches grade as plus at their best, and he's throwing more strikes than ever. To succeed in a pro rotation, he'll need to develop a changeup after having little use for one to this point of his career.

His changeup grades better than his slider at times, though it also lacks consistency. Zeferjahn is athletic but tends to get under his pitches, costing him control and quality. He doesn't have a track record of throwing strikes, leading several scouts to project a move the bullpen, where he could regularly feature a double-plus fastball in shorter stints.

The right-handed hitter has a solid approach at the plate with very good bat-to-ball skills that have allowed him to hit over .400 this spring.

He has almost no history against quality pitching and faces weak prep competition, so scouts aren't sure what to make of his bat, but he has enough promise that he could go as early as the third round. Unlike Hamilton, Beard shows the potential to make some impact at the plate. He has a quick right-handed swing and strength in his hands, and he flashes the ability to backspin balls. He'll have to prove he can manage the strike zone and handle breaking pitches, but he has the upside of at least an average hitter with double-digit home run power.

There's some power in his right-handed swing and he's starting to show he can get to it in games. Even with those improvements, it's his glovework that stands out. While he's big and strong at 6-foot-4, scouts think he can stick at shortstop with a Troy Tulowitzki-like defensive profile. He moves very well for his size with a cannon for an arm. Even if he had to move, he has the skills to be a Gold Glove-caliber third baseman. Known for his natural leadership skills, Kreidler has a tendency to be on winning teams, including his Cape Cod League squad last summer.

He has easy power from the left side of the plate and has a good right-handed swing as well, with more gap power from that side. A shortstop in high school, Johnson moved to second base at Chipola because they had a superior defender there and, to his credit, he was willing to do whatever was needed to make the team better.

Omaha's TD Ameritrade Park is one of the toughest places to hit a home run in college baseball, yet it hasn't been able to contain Robertson, whose short, quick left-handed stroke and strength give him some of the best power in the 2019 college crop. He lets his home runs come naturally rather than swinging for the fences, making repeated contact that could allow him to hit for average as well. To do so, scouts believe he'll need to get more upright in his stance like he was in the past before getting too spread out as a junior. Robertson has below-average speed out of the batter's box but is closer to average once he gets going. He needs to improve his defensive instincts and his arm is merely average, so he could shift from right field at Creighton to left field in pro ball.

His fastball dipped into the mid-80s and his slider was less sharp, and he didn't show he could succeed or hold up as starter. Stinson may have the best slider in the Draft when he's 100 percent, displaying mid-80s velocity and two-plane break that make it a plus-plus pitch at its best. He also has a better fastball than most left-handers when he's at his best, operating at 91-96 mph with some sink. His changeup is in its nascent stages because he hadn't needed it much coming out of the bullpen. Even before his confusing year, Stinson came with some red flags.

At first glance, Cairo might not stand out to most as an under-sized middle infielder without wow tools. Watch him for longer and those plus instincts and feel for the game allow him to play above his tools. He has shown a good feel to hit, making consistent contact while showing the ability to do the little things well, like hit behind runners and drag bunt. There's not a ton of present strength or power and that's not likely to be a part of his game at the next level. Defensively, he has good hands and a decent arm, but some see a move to second base in his future given his average speed.

Pierce College, a two-year school, Lewis moved to UC-Irvine and weighed in at 215 lbs. He's put up some serious numbers in a pitching-friendly park to put himself firmly on the Draft map. There's little doubt that it will be Lewis' bat that will carry him as a professional, and he has the chance to hit for power and average. The ball does not travel in his home park, but he was flirting with the school's single-season home run record as the Draft approached. There is some length to his swing, and it can get grooved at times, which can be exposed, but scouts think he has the chance to hit enough to tap into his enormous raw power at the next level. He's a better athlete than he appears to be and has the hands to stay at third, though there's some concern his fringy arm won't work from the hot corner long term. Whether he sticks at third or has to move to first, Lewis is going to have to hit his way up to the big leagues.

Kahle's been the starter since, and while he might not surpass his predecessor in terms of when he gets taken, he's had a tremendous junior season to raise his stock. Kahle has been hitting with a lot of confidence all spring, giving scouts hope he'll hit for average at the next level. He's shown the ability to catch up to good fastballs with solid bat speed and recognizes breaking stuff well, which he's gotten a lot of as teams have pitched around him. He tends to show mostly gap power, but he does stay inside the ball well and shows some ability to turn on pitches for some home run power. Short and stocky, Kahle is a below-average runner and doesn't have that much agility behind the plate. He has improved his receiving and blocks well, and while his arm is fringy strength-wise, it's accurate.

McCann's best tool is his plus raw left-handed power, and he uses the strength and leverage in his 6-foot-2 frame to drive the ball to all fields. There's some swing and miss in his game and he has yet to have much success with wood bats, so he probably won't hit for a high average. But he compensates by working deep counts and drawing plenty of walks to fuel healthy on-base percentages. There are mixed reviews of McCann's defensive prowess, though a team that believes in his ability to catch and loves his lefty pop could take him as high as the second round.

Agnos is just 5-foot-11 but produces 88-93 mph fastballs and tops out at 95 with a combination of arm speed and an effortful delivery. His best pitch is his curveball, a plus offering in the upper 70s with 12-6 break when at its best. He also can display a decent changeup but struggles with his feel for the pitch. Agnos' size, mechanics and inconsistent command have him pointed to the bullpen in pro ball. Working in shorter stints, he could have two plus pitches with a harder fastball and curve.

Barber has the potential to have an offensive profile that fits well in an outfield corner. Using a wide stance, Barber has a quick swing that allows him to barrel up the ball consistently. There's current and even more future power to come in his left-handed swing. An above-average runner, Barber has recorded plus 60-yard times at showcases, is a good baserunner and generally gets good reads and routes in the outfield.

The right-hander is having an extraordinary senior year and belongs in top-three-round consideration based on his talent, but it should be noted that it took Harris and Drake nearly seven years to make it all the way to the Majors. Song has a legitimate starting pitcher profile coming from a 6-foot-4 frame. He'll get his fastball consistently up to 96 mph and maintains that velocity throughout his starts, with the only drawback being that it can be a little straight at times. He gets a lot of swings and misses with his above-average slider and some feel that his curveball could be good enough to do the same if he were to throw it more. He can mix in a solid changeup as well and has done a much better job throwing strikes this year. He does have a little bit of an inverted elbow in the back of his delivery, which might cause some of the inconsistencies with his curve, but overall has not kept him from being very effective. The big question mark is about Song's required two-year military service before he potentially could join a Major League organization and the current policy is to not let potential professional athletes forego that requirement (the Air Force's Griffin Jax was able to join the Twins before that rule was changed). So any team interested in Song's considerable upside will be rolling the dice."

He began driving the ball more often and had success doing so with wood bats in the Cape Cod League last summer, and he has tried to hit for more power this spring. With his current approach, he projects as a possible .270 hitter with 15 homers per season as a pro. Rave's best tool is his speed, and he'll flash some plus-plus times but play more as a plus runner. He's still learning as a basestealer and shows just average instincts in center field, so he's not getting as much out of his quickness as he can.

The two-seamer has plus sink and run at times, sometimes throwing with cutter-like action. He'll throw both a curve and slider and though both blend into each other and get slurvy, he does have feel to spin it. The slider is a tick ahead now, but the curve could provide a different contrast with more depth from his cutting fastball in the future.

This spring, a bout with mono slowed him, but also may have enabled him to get back to being a better all-around hitter. When at his best, Frechette shows the ability to barrel up the baseball consistently. When he first was returning from mono, he shortened up his swing and got to more pitches.

Morris has a very good track record for hitting and most scouts believe he'll continue to hit for average at the next level. The left-handed hitter sends a lot of line drives the other way and controls the strike zone extremely well. Virginia's home park is not conducive to power, nor is Morris' current approach, but as he continues to learn how to turn on pitches on the inner half of the plate as well as fills out his 6-foot-2 frame, there could be more pop coming in the future.

Stallings lacks a true plus pitch, but he has several effective offerings and there's no clear consensus as to which is his best. Though his fastball velocity is nothing special at 88-91 mph and a peak of 93, his heater plays up because he sinks and commands it so well, and it works well in concert with his changeup that features similar movement.

Dyson still has plenty of power to go after hitters when he wants it. His fastball will touch 96-97 mph, and he consistently reaches the mid-90s. But a lack of life has meant it's gotten hit hard when he throws it for a strike. He has struggled to throw his slider, which had flashed plus in the past, for a strike, and he hasn't been able to develop a reliable third pitch, so college hitters have been sitting on the fastball. He has a tendency to not drive through the ball and can be too rotational, giving hitters too good of a look at the ball coming out of his hand. Because of his struggles, scouts have a hard time projecting Dyson as a starter at this point. If he can refine his fastball-slider combination, some see a ceiling as a setup type who can pitch the seventh or eighth inning, though a team taking him early in the Draft could send him out as a starter with the hopes of fixing what's ailed him this spring."

A transfer from Bellevue Junior College the year prior, Shenton really struggled out of the gate, at least in part under the weight of his mother undergoing cancer treatments across the country, but he started to swing the bat better as the spring wore on. Shenton does have a really good left-handed swing when he's at his best, using the whole field well, giving some the belief he'll hit for average at the next level. After he started slowly, he might have tried too hard to catch up and was jumping at the ball and wasn't on time with his swing during games, though he did reel off a long hitting streak to bring his average up. There's some pull power to tap into, though he's definitely a hit over power type of offensive player. With a thicker build, Shenton's range is a little limited, and a hamstring injury this spring didn't help, but he has the chance to be adequate at third with a solid arm. If third doesn't work, he could be an offensive-minded second baseman or perhaps handle left field. Scouts who like Shenton and think the guy they saw in the Cape is who he is see a little Kyle Seager in him, though his slow start may have turned some teams off. This might be an opportunity for a team to buy low on a college bat on Day 2 of the Draft."

Three years of pitching at Santa Barbara later, topped off by an outstanding junior season as the Gauchos' Friday night starter, have moved him firmly into the Day 2 picture. While Brecht still doesn't have wow stuff, he does throw harder than his high school days and has shown a very good feel for pitching. His fastball typically sits in the low-90s, but hitters don't see it because Brecht uses his 6-foot-7 frame well to create deception and gets excellent extension so his average heater gets on hitters in a hurry. With good movement up in the zone, he gets a lot of strikeouts with his fastball above the bat. His best secondary pitch is his changeup and he sells it well. His slider is fringy, but he mixes it in effectively. Brecht has done an outstanding job of throwing quality strikes as UCSB's ace and all of his stuff plays up because of his ability to command the ball, his size and the deception in his delivery.

His talent dictated that he would have gone in the top five rounds of the 2016 Draft, but he fell to the Mariners in the 35th because he was set on attending Mississippi and becoming part of college baseball's top recruiting class. After two years as a reliever, he has fared well as the Rebels' No. 1 starter. Ethridge excels at pitching to contact with a 91-93 mph fastball that tops out at 95, creating groundballs and awkward swings with sink and the extension in his low-three-quarters delivery. His low-80s slider can be a solid offering when he stays on top of it, though it also can get sweepy and slurvy at times. His fading changeup similarly varies between effectiveness and inconsistency. Strong and durable, Ethridge does a nice job of repeating his simple mechanics. He doesn't overpower hitters but he puts his pitches where he wants and limits damage done by walks or home runs. He's one of the safer bets in this year's college class to become at least a back-of-the-rotation starter."

His 112 strikeouts this year are the second-most in school history, though he went just 1-7 with a 4.85 ERA for a 15-41 club. Nevertheless, he should surpass David Buchanan (seventh round, 2010) as the highest-drafted Panther ever. When he's on top of his game, Gaddis attacks hitters with a low-90s sinker and a mid-80s slider/cutter. Too often this spring, he lacked deception and command of his two-seam fastball and relied on his fringy curveball at the expense of his better breaking ball. He also struggled with the feel for his changeup, which has some fade but sometimes arrives in the upper 60s. Gaddis opens up too early in his delivery, which can add some sink to his two-seamer but detracts from his other offerings. While he never has had trouble finding the zone, he needs to improve the quality of his strikes rather than just laying the ball over the middle of the plate. If he focuses on his sinker and slider and betters his command in pro ball, he should fare better than he did in his final college season."

He's added a bunch more as a junior, but some scouts feel he has the repertoire and feel for pitching to start at the next level. The 6-foot-4 right-hander has the potential to have a four-pitch mix should he get the chance to be in a rotation. He's added a little velocity while at Stanford and can touch 94 mph on occasion, but typically sits in the 90-92 mph range with his fastball. He added a curveball in his sophomore season and it's become his go-to breaking ball. He continues to work on his slider, and some think if he does end up in a bullpen at the next level, that would be a better breaking ball option for him. He can mix in a solid changeup as well. Stanford has opted to have pitchers with starting potential stay in the bullpen because it's more valuable to be able to use them multiple times over the weekend. That's what they did with Hock, who did get some opportunities to start with the Marlins since he was a fourth-round pick in 2017.

Three years later scouts still aren't sure where he fits best, but he's a switch-hitter who has hit for power in the Southeastern Conference and draws some ""poor man's Kyle Schwarber"" comparisons. Dillard generates impressive raw pop with a combination of bat speed, strength and loft in his swing. He has improved his plate discipline and contact rate throughout his college career and has a chance to hit for average as well. Though he has below-average speed, he's aggressive on the bases and has good feel for picking spots to steal. Dillard has played mostly left field at Mississippi, showing at least average arm strength but limited range. The hope is that he can become an adequate defender in left, but he could wind up at first base or DH.

Brown peaked at 91 mph with his fastball as a freshman, at 93 mph as a sophomore and at 95 mph on Wayne State's scout day last fall. This spring he has shown the ability to sit at 96-98 mph for three innings at a time, work consistently at 92-96 and maintain overpowering velocity on his four-seamer deep into games. The pitch stands out more for the downhill plane that results from his high-three-quarters arm slot than its life, though he also will throw a two-seamer with some sink in the low 90s. His slider also has gotten considerably better during his time at Wayne State, and it can be a plus pitch in the mid-80s with bite and depth at its best.

Before his breakout, Groshans showed the ability to make consistent contact to all fields with a repeatable right-handed swing during two solid summers in the Cape Cod League. He has gotten stronger and is making a more concerted effort to pull and drive the ball as a junior.

He has shown significant improvement as a hitter and receiver this spring, putting him in position to get selected in the same range as Fortes. Any discussion of Johnson still starts with his arm, a well above-average cannon that regularly registers sub-1.9-second pop times and helped him erase 45 percent of basestealers during the 2019 regular season. He has worked hard to improve his receiving and blocking, which had been subpar in the past but now elicit average to solid grades. His overall defensive game is good enough to project him as at least a big league backup.

Known more for his polish in the past, Fellows isn't blowing away hitters but is sitting in the low 90s more often and topping out at 95 mph with his sinker. His low-80s slider is sharper as well, giving him a solid second pitch. He must continue to refine his changeup in order to handle left-handers at the next level.

He uses his high-three-quarters arm slot to stay on top of his curveball, which stands out more for its depth than its power. Bradford has a clean delivery and repeats it very well, allowing him to put his pitches where he wants. He earns high marks for his competitiveness and intelligence.

The biggest thing holding Rosario back offensively is his current lack of strength. He has good hand-eye coordination and makes a lot of contact, but isn't strong enough to impact the ball consistently. His right-handed swing gets long at times when he tries to muscle up and he definitely lengthens his swing to get leverage to show power in batting practice.

He did lead the Big South Conference in strikeouts for the second straight year, however, and still should fit in the first five or six rounds. Peek uses both a low-90s sinker and a harder four-seam fastball, and he can maintain his velocity into the late innings. His curveball hasn't been as sharp as usual, though it still flashes good depth and he's throwing it for strikes. He masks his changeup well and it features some fade. Peek has a clean delivery and repeats his high-three-quarters arm slot well.

On the other, they might not have the same track record against good competition to compare to other prep arms from around the country. Limoncelli helped offset that some with a strong summer, but questions about his health when his stuff backed up as things warmed up in New York this spring, and it turned out he needed Tommy John surgery. Over the summer, Limoncelli routinely was touching 93-94 mph with his fastball with a repeatable delivery and loose arm action. When he broke out of the gate only up to 89 mph this spring, it was easy to chalk that up to it being his first outing, and one of the first times he'd been able to throw outside this year. He was up to 92 mph early in his second start, but the velocity fell off quickly, leading some evaluators to worry about his health. He can spin his breaking ball decently and while he does have a changeup, it's decidedly behind the other two pitches. He generally is a strike-thrower. While Limoncelli has limited projection when healthy, there is enough in his three-pitch mix to garner interest.

He has averageish velocity on his fastball, ranging from 88-95 mph, but well above-average life that generates a lot of swings and misses as well as groundballs. He also commands his heater well, and the net result is that it plays as a plus pitch. Wesneski has a sweepy slider that's effective because it moves in the opposite direction from his sinker.

A rare player who bats right-handed and throws left-handed, Barefoot has a lot of movement and effort in his unorthodox swing but makes it work with good hand-eye coordination.

Despite his quickness and an arm that has been clocked up to 94 mph on the mound, Barefoot has played mostly left field for the Fighting Camels. He has the tools to be a better defender and would profile more as a regular if he could handle center field, where he'll likely get an opportunity in pro ball.

He dominated as a freshman closer on LSU's 2017 College World Series runner-up team before moving into the rotation the next two years to fill a need for the team. He hasn't been nearly as effective as a starter and missed time this spring with a groin injury, and most pro clubs project him as a late-inning reliever. When he finished games as a freshman, Hess pumped his fastball into the upper 90s and backed it up with a wipeout slider in the mid 80s. As a starter, he usually operates with a 91-95 mph fastball and a solid slider in the low 80s. His 6-foot-6 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot create downhill plane and both pitches feature high spin rates, making him difficult to hit. Hess hasn't shown much feel for a changeup and won't need it much if he shifts back into the bullpen in pro ball.

Millas should extend that streak this June, following Tate Matheny (Red Sox, fourth round, 2015), Jake Burger (White Sox, first, 2017) and Jeremy Eierman (Athletics, second, 2018). He rivals Baylor's Shea Langeliers as the best defensive catcher in college baseball. Millas is extremely athletic for his position, flashing above-average run times and moving around behind the plate like an infielder. He has soft hands and excels at blocking and receiving. He also has a strong and accurate arm, the leadership skills desired in a catcher and calls his own game -- a rarity in college. Millas offers some raw power, but he has gotten too wrapped up in trying to lift and drive the ball during a rough junior season offensively. He's a switch-hitter who's significantly better from the left side, and some evaluators wonder if he'd be better off giving up batting right-handed.

Though he's a purely a reliever, he has a chance to become Northwestern's highest pick since J.A. Happ was a third-rounder in 2004. Still somewhat of a work in progress on the mound, Paciorek could have two plus offerings once he's fully developed. His best is an 82-85 mph slider that's a legitimate strikeout pitch. He usually works at 90-94 mph and can hit 96 with his fastball, with more velocity to come as he gets more experience. Paciorek impresses with his athleticism and his arm works well.

Cotton lacks one truly loud tool, but can do a lot of little things to impact the game. He has a contact-oriented approach and rarely strikes out, though he doesn't draw a ton of walks, either. He'll show off raw power in batting practice, but it has yet to show up in games. A tick above-average as a runner, Cotton likely is a left fielder at the next level because of his below-average arm, but could fill in as a center fielder because of his excellent instincts. Grand Canyon has become a vastly improved program under Stankiewicz, one that annually churns out Draft talent.

He set an Elon record with 147 strikeouts in 105 innings as a sophomore in 2018, when he also pitched well in brief stints with the U.S. collegiate national team and in the Cape Cod League. Brnovich's success results primarily from a single pitch, an 82-85 knuckle-curve he can manipulate to have either deeper or more lateral break. It may be the best breaking ball in the college ranks. He has spent most of the spring working with an 88-91 mph fastball with some sink and run, though he reached 94 mph as a reliever with Team USA last summer, and he also has a changeup with some fade. He throws a lot of knuckle-curves and Brnovich figures to rely even more heavily on his breaking ball as a pro because he's almost certainly headed to the bullpen. Scouts don't love his delivery, which includes a short arm action, plenty of effort and some head whack, though it does help him hide the ball.

He has produced at the plate for Ohio State for three straight seasons and tied Nick Swisher's school record by reaching base in 51 consecutive games this spring, a streak that was still active at the end of the regular season. Adding more power to his profile this year could help him become just the second Buckeyes position player to get picked in the top five rounds during the last decade. Canzone uses his hand-eye coordination and a disciplined approach to make hard contact to all fields. After struggling to drive the ball in the Cape Cod League last summer, he has become less spread out at the plate and has added some loft to what had been a flat stroke. He still features more strength than bat speed, but his 15 regular-season homers more than doubled his total from his first two years, and he added pop without compromising his ability to control the strike zone. A below-average runner out of the batter's box, Canzone is closer to average underway and shows some savvy on the bases. He's a decent defender with an average arm, albeit limited to left field. The team that drafts him will have to bank on his bat, which may be good enough to get him to the big leagues."

Adcock didn't envision a future on the mound when he joined the Fighting Christians as a catcher, redshirting in his first season in 2016 and not pitching until two years later, when he logged a 6.94 ERA in 10 appearances. The redshirt junior has served as Elon's closer while also doubling as its starting right fielder this spring. Adcock deals at 93-97 mph with riding life on his four-seam fastball, and scouts believe he could push triple digits once he focuses solely on pitching in pro ball. He backs up his heat with a low-80s slider that shows signs of becoming a plus pitch. Some scouts have seen him flash a changeup but he rarely uses it in games. The effort in Adcock's high-three-quarters delivery limits him to coming out of the bullpen. His control has improved in his second season of pitching, yet it's still below average and he'll have to throw more strikes to succeed against more advanced hitters.

He raised it a bit more with a strong performance over the summer in the Cape Cod League. An inconsistent junior season has kept him from reaching that bar again this spring, making it a bit tougher to gauge when in the Draft he might get selected. A solid athlete with a good 6-foot-3 frame, DeVito has still shown glimpses of the three-pitch mix that had scouts excited for his junior year. He'll be up to 94 mph with his fastball consistently, sitting 91-92 mph more often than not. At times, when he gets good extension, he has good life on the pitch, at others, he's seen his fastball get barreled up. His breaking ball will occasionally flash above-average, but he has a tendency to collapse his front leg when he throws it. His go-to pitch has been his changeup, which he sells well and can throw with fade to both sides of the plate. DeVito's inconsistency with his delivery and release point has impacted his command as well, but he has shown a better ability to throw quality strikes in the past.

He missed two weeks in April with elbow inflammation but returned to the mound with his stuff intact. Kostyshock's fastball has climbed from 86-89 mph his freshman season to 92-96 two years later, and there could be more velocity to come if he can add some muscle to his lanky 6-foot-4 frame. His long arms and three-quarters slot create deception and difficult angle on his heater, especially against right-handers. His mid-80s slider features lateral break and can be a plus pitch at times, though it also flattens out when he doesn't stay on top of it. Kostyshock opened the season in Arkansas' weekend rotation, but he made just one start and hasn't shown a changeup since settling in the bullpen.

Whether he'll be signable this time around as a sophomore-eligible remains to be seen. Clarke stands out as a lefty-hitting catcher with the ability to handle the bat. He regularly puts the barrel on the ball, uses the entire field and manages the strike zone well. He has more strength than bat speed and possesses solid raw power, though he's more concerned with making quality contact than swinging for the fences. If Clarke can continue to improve his defense, he has a chance to become a big league regular. He looks quicker and more agile than he did in high school, though his receiving skills are fringy and need more work. He has similar arm strength but his quick release helps him keep the running game in check."

When he followed that up with 11 shoutout innings for USA Baseball's Collegiate National Team, he looked poised to be one of the more intriguing college lefties in the 2019 Draft class. But a forearm issue slowed him early as his velocity dipped, hurting his stock considerably, though he was pitching better as the Draft approached. At his best, Feole leans heavily on his fastball-curve combination. When he's 100 percent healthy, he'll sit around 90-92 mph with his heater. His breaking ball is a pure curveball that he throws a lot as his out pitch. It will flash plus at times, but he doesn't always land it consistently. He does have a below-average changeup, but rarely is asked to throw it. An unorthodox delivery that includes a head snap adversely impacts his command on a regular basis. Having put the forearm injury behind him helps his stock, but because of the effort in his delivery and his difficulty in finding the strike zone consistently, most see a move to the bullpen in Feole's future. In shorter stints, his two-pitch repertoire could play well and still land him in the top five rounds."

That prospect was supposed to be catcher/right-hander Logan Tanner, but he has been surpassed by McDonald, who broke out by reaching 95 mph in a January showcase. He acquitted himself well during the spring, dominating highly touted Jerrion Ealy and Jackson Prep in March and fanning 30 in a pair of playoff starts in April. McDonald regularly sits at 91-93 mph with running action on his fastball and should hold his velocity deeper into games as he gets stronger. His low-80s slider isn't as reliable yet but projects as a second solid offering, and he also owns a curveball with good depth. Though he hasn't needed a changeup very often, he has shown the makings of a decent one with some sink. McDonald's arm action is a bit long but he repeats his delivery well and generally throws strikes. He comes with some concerns about his size, listed at what scouts believe is a generous 6-foot-2, and his lack of history against quality competition. He's also a good student who may be difficult to sign away from a South Alabama commitment."

Keane is the quintessential projectable prep right-hander from a cold-weather state. The Northeastern commit does have the chance to have a solid starting pitcher's repertoire, but most of it is the kind of stuff scouts need to dream on. He'll be anywhere in the 87-93 mph range with his fastball currently, but his athletic 6-foot-3 frame should allow him to add strength and plenty of velocity. His breaking ball can be slurvy, sometimes looking like a curve, sometimes having more slider shape to it, and it should be at least average in time. His changeup is a work in progress, but he does show some feel for it. Keane does have a very easy arm action and while there are kinks in his delivery, he's athletic enough to believe he'll work those out and become a solid strike-thrower.

Contreras, a middle infielder with some present hitting skills, was the only player to hit homer in this year's event. Big and strong, Contreras has more present strength than some of his fellow Puerto Rican infielders in the class. When he keeps his swing under control, he can drive the ball. He has serious raw power, especially to the pull side, but has the tendency to lose his mechanics and get out of control trying to show off that power. A solid runner when underway, there is some question over whether he has the range to stick at shortstop, though most teams would send him out at the spot and see if he can stick there. He has a plus arm and good enough hands for the position. If Contreras does slow down as he matures, he still has a future on the dirt, perhaps as an offensive second baseman.

Buehler was more polished and Collyer needs to get a lot stronger, so he may not get picked high enough to divert him from attending Clemson. He has the potential to blossom into a first-round pick after three years of college just like Buehler did. Though he lacks physicality, Collyer has an electric arm capable of running fastballs up to 96 mph and sitting at 90-92 with running action. His frame easily could add another 30 pounds, after which he might operate in the mid-90s and push triple digits. He also flashes promising power on his slider, which lacks consistency but can be a plus pitch when he stays on top of it. Collyer also shows the makings of an effective changeup, though he doesn't need to use it much against high schoolers. There's a lot going on in his delivery, which includes excessive effort and some head whack that impede his ability to command his pitches.

Short won't wow anyone with the velocity on his fastball, which usually ranges from 88-90 mph and tops out at 93, but it's an effective pitch because it features nice sink and he commands it so well. His best offering is a mid-70s curveball with quality depth, and he can turn it into a harder slider with sharp break. He also demonstrates feel for a changeup with some tumble. His pitches play up because Short throws them all from the same high three-quarters slot, making it tougher for hitters to figure out what's coming. He has little effort in his simple delivery, repeating it with ease while pounding the strike zone with his entire repertoire.

But evaluators prefer to come in packages well above six feet tall. When a pitcher like Owens, who is 5-foot-10, can crank it up velocity-wise, the enthusiasm often comes with a bit more caution. While Owens is undersized, he has compact strength and athleticism on the mound. And he has plenty of arm, consistently firing fastballs up to 94-95 mph this spring. He'll also flash a solid slider that has good short break and he even has some feel for a changeup with some fade, though he doesn't need to use it very often at his current level. Like with many high school pitchers, he's more control over command, though he tends to find the strike zone fairly consistently. This is where the questions come in. With his size, scouts wonder if Owens will be durable enough to be a starter at the next level. His fastball-breaking ball combination likely would play up in a bullpen role, but high schoolers with reliever profiles are hard to place on a Draft board. If things don't work out for him this June, we may be talking about him again after three years pitching for the Florida Gators."

And only one player, 24th rounder Tim Adleman in 2010, has made it to the big leagues. Morreale, who moved into the Hoyas rotation as a junior and has two years of relief experience, not to mention pitching out of the 'pen in the Cape Cod League last summer, on his resume, hopes to add to both of those groups of one. While Morreale has been inconsistent as a starter, he has shown premium arm strength in spurts. He'll often be up to 95 mph early in starts coming from his 6-foot-5 frame, but will drop down to the low-90s as his starts wear on. He throws both a cutter in the upper-80s and a true 83-85 mph slider, though the two pitches often morph into each other. He has a changeup, but it's inconsistent. He has struggled at times with his command, perhaps because of his arm action, but his delivery has not raised any major red flags. It's possible Morreale's velocity doesn't hold because he doesn't have a long resume as a starter. A team drafting him could send him out in a rotation to see what happens, but there's a good chance his power arsenal will look better in shorter stints, where he could even see a bigger uptick in his stuff."

He slammed 17 homers and broke the school's freshman RBI record held by Frank Thomas with 69 last spring. Though he's just a 20-year-old sophomore, MLB ruled him eligible for the 2019 Draft in March after deciding that his year at a Canadian secondary school was equivalent to a year in college. Julien is geared to hit for power and offers more than most left-handed college hitters in this year's class. His considerable strength and a stroke that features plenty of bat speed and loft combine to give him the ability to drive the ball out of any part of the ballpark. He draws a lot of walks because opponents are reluctant to challenge him, though there's also a lot of swing and miss in his game because he's so aggressive and will expand his strike zone. While Julien could stand to moderate his offensive approach, finding him a defensive home is a greater concern. After playing right field and second base as a freshman, he has looked shaky at third base this spring. With below-average speed, fringy arm strength and rough infield actions, he's likely destined for left field or first base."

But he added more power to his arsenal this spring, giving him one of the best fastballs among Lone Star State prepsters and making him more attractive to pro clubs. He'll be the first player ever drafted from Rouse High (Leander). Southard's fastball sat in the upper 80s last summer but has taken off as he has added strength to his 6-foot-2 frame. He's now operating in the low 90s with nice sink on his two-seamer and topping out at 96 mph with his four-seamer. He has impressive feel for spin, using both an upper-70s curveball with good depth and a low-80s slider with tighter bite. As is the case with most high school pitchers, Southard's changeup lags behind his other offerings because he hasn't had much need for it. There's effort in his high-three-quarters delivery, which can lead to inconsistent control, but his athleticism should allow him to make improvements. He has the upside of a No. 3 starter if he remains in the rotation or a late-inning reliever if he winds up in the bullpen."

It's been evident in the polish he's shown as a New Jersey high school standout on the last summer's showcase circuit, for Team USA and then again this spring on a big stage at USA Baseball's National High School Invitational. From a velocity standpoint, Leiter often utilizes an average fastball, thrown in the 91-92 mph range, though he can go get 94-95 mph when he needs it. It plays up because he throws it with some sink and has outstanding command of the pitch. He has shown distinct breaking balls in the past, though he's been leaning on the curve more frequently this spring, and it was a true knee-buckling out pitch during his NHSI win. He has feel for a solid changeup as well, even if he doesn't need it much at his current level. Leiter is much more advanced than most high schoolers in terms of his feel for pitching and command, he presents himself more like a polished college starter. There isn't much projection in his frame, reminding some of a Mike Leake type, with slightly better stuff. He might very well be the same pitcher, albeit with a track record of SEC success, should he head to Vanderbilt. He will be sophomore-eligible should that happen."

It starts with potential first-rounders in right-hander Brennan Malone and infielder Rece Hinds and includes another Top 100 prospect in righty Kendall Williams. Rivera looked like he could be in that same grouping during a solid performance on the summer showcase circuit. A knee injury slowed him early and got him off of his game a little bit during his senior season. When he's at his best, Rivera looks like he has the chance to be a very good hitter at the next level. When he's on time with his swing, he shows the ability to drive the ball the other way, making it easier to dream about him being an above-average hitter with at least average power down the line. He's struggled this spring to stay on the ball long enough, perhaps pressing to make up for lost time. A decent athlete who runs well underway, he should be a solid defender at the hot corner with enough arm to stay there in the long-term. Teams willing to consider Rivera based more on his summer and fall than his spring performance might see a player who belongs closer in the conversation with his IMG teammates.

Brown and fellow 2019 prep outfielder Jerrion Ealy. Named Mr. Tennessee Football at the Division II 3-A level last fall, Hampton not only is one of the Draft's top outfielders but also a four-star cornerback ticketed to play two sports at Louisiana State if he doesn't turn pro. The most athletic prospect to come out of Tennessee in years, he hasn't quite impressed enough this spring to become the state's first prep position player to go in the first round since Mike White in 1986. Like most athletes who star in multiple sports, Hampton needs refinement on the diamond, but his huge upside could make the patience that will be required in his development worth it. His right-handed swing could get smoother but still generates impressive bat speed and exit velocities, giving him the potential for 25 or more homers on an annual basis if he makes enough contact. He struggled against quality pitching early on the showcase circuit last summer but continually improved and gave a glimpse of what he might be if he focused on baseball. Hampton has dynamic tools beyond his raw power. He's also a well above-average runner who can make an impact as a basestealer and a defender. He definitely has the quickness for center field, though he needs to refine his reads and routes, and also flashes plus arm strength that will enable him to play anywhere in the outfield."

He continued to raise his profile by hitting 97 mph at a tournament in Arizona during his first outing of his senior season in March. Though he hasn't lit up radar guns as consistently this spring, few high school pitchers in this Draft can match his combination of peak velocity and projectability. Rustad's fastball fluctuated with the weather in the Midwest, parking at 90-93 mph on some days and at 88-91 on others. He could operate in the mid-90s on a regular basis once he fills out his lean 6-foot-5 frame. He uses his size to create difficult angle and his heater also features high spin rates, as does a low-80s slider that gives him a sharp second pitch when he stays on top of it. His changeup still is in the early stages of development, but Rustad shows some feel for it. The San Diego recruit has an athletic delivery, his arm works well and he can spot his fastball on both sides of the plate when he's on. He'll need some time to develop but has all of the ingredients to become at least a mid-rotation starter."

He was a bit inconsistent last summer, and then was pitching better for his Jacksonville area high school to put an up arrow next to his name. A mild shoulder strain that shelved him for a while did put a damper on his spring. The 6-foot-4 southpaw has the ideal pitcher's body, with room to fill out and see his stuff tick upward, especially once he stops being a two-way player. His velocity fluctuated over the summer, but was up to 94 mph this spring with good arm-side movement. He'll flash an excellent slider, though he can get underneath it at times, impacting it's consistency, and he has good feel for an above-average changeup as well. While he was stronger this spring, Barco still throws from a lower slot than some scouts would like. He struggles repeating his release point, which can lead to command issues. That arm slot does create deception in his delivery, though, often making him tough to hit. Teams willing to take him early and sign him away from his University of Florida commitment would have to believe theres more in the tank and that they can work with the lefty to clean up his delivery once he becomes a pro. But he was shut down for a period of time leading up to the Draft, leading many to believe he could end up heading to Florida."

Eskew, a two-way player for his high school team, has the chance to join Wilson based on his mound work talent-wise, though signability could come into play. Eskew is a prototypical projection high school right-hander with a lot to dream on. Velocity-wise, his fastball is average now, up to 92-93 mph. Given his size and solid delivery, not to mention a focus on pitching only, it's easy to envision him sitting in the mid 90s in the future. His fastball is largely straight, with a little run in on right-handed hitters, something that might be addressed if he drops his high arm angle a touch. At times, Eskew will show both a curve and a slider, but they tend to run into each other. He does have feel to spin, and it could end up being a better-than-average pitch once he hones in on one breaking ball. He doesn't throw a changeup much but will show some feel for it in the bullpen. It's a pitch he has the aptitude to learn. While he is raw, Eskew is a solid strike-thrower, though his command within the strike zone will need to be refined. Many scouts feel that, along with a sharpening of his stuff, will come with more innings and attention to pitching. Whether that happens in the Minor Leagues or at the University of Miami remains to be seen."

Christian High's Ethan Hearn could be the first prep catcher selected in 2019, there are scouts who believe he's not the best in his own city. They prefer LaRue's superior athleticism and think he'll be a better hitter and receiver. There also are evaluators who wonder if LaRue might have a future on the mound, where he shows a low-90s fastball and closed out the clinching game as McGill-Toolen Catholic won its first state 7-A title in May. A former outfielder who's more athletic than most catchers, LaRue moves well behind the plate. He's already an average receiver and should continue to improve as he gains more experience. He has a solid, accurate arm that could play as plus if he can learn to quicken his release. LaRue's proponents like his relatively compact right-handed swing and his willingness to use the opposite field, though some scouts wonder if he'll make regular contact against more advanced pitching. The Auburn recruit has solid raw power and lets it come naturally rather than worrying about home runs. He has close to average speed but will slow down as he matures physically and spends more time behind the plate."

It's had four players drafted in the past two years, but only one -- Ryan Dease a fourth-rounder in 2017 -- taken in the top 10 rounds. Charles left The First Academy for TNXL this season and could very well be the next, though a commitment to North Carolina could stand in the way. Based solely on arm strength, Charles deserves to be much higher on this list. He's up to 96-97 mph consistently with his fastball and there could be more in the tank with some tweaks to his delivery, though his four-seamer is fairly straight. There's some violence to his delivery, with a short arm action, that impacts his ability to command his heater and his secondary stuff. He throws a power curve which sometimes gets slurvy and morphs into his slider, with some scouts thinking the slider would be a better option given his arm action. He does have a changeup, which can be effective at times, but he never needs to throw it and needs development. Because of his power stuff, delivery and lack of command, some see Charles as a future reliever, which is a bit of a tough profile for a high schooler. That and what might be a high price tag to keep him from being a Tar Heel could send him to college in the fall."

The son of a 1988 Olympics taekwondo participant (Tami Noel) and a former sprinter (Roy McFarlane), he may have the best chance to remain a starter among the Peach State's best prep arms this spring. He's also strongly committed to Miami, so he could slide out of the top five rounds. Projectable and athletic, McFarlane could have two plus pitches once he matures physically. He can reach 95 mph early in games and sit at 90-93 with riding action for stretches, though his velocity faded a bit as the Draft approached. He gets good break on his upper-70s slider, which should be a more dynamic offering once it adds more power. McFarlane already shows the ability to throw his changeup for strikes. He has a fairly clean delivery, which allows him to repeat it well but doesn't provide much deception. He could have the upside of a No. 3 starter once he gets stronger."

History is repeating itself this year, and while he may not go quite as high as Cody Reed did, Fowler has a better breaking ball at the same stage. He has backed out of a commitment to Mississippi, so he'll return to the Rangers for his sophomore season if he doesn't turn pro. Fowler had a low-80s fastball as a Tennessee high school junior in 2017 and improved to the mid-80s as a senior before jumping to 90-93 mph at times as a junior college freshman. There were games when he operated more in the upper 80s, but he's still growing into his lanky 6-foot-5 frame and could sit in the mid-90s with sink once he's fully developed. He also shows an affinity for spinning a curveball, though he sometimes has trouble staying on top of it because he employs a lower-three-quarters arm slot. Fowler also displays some feel for a changeup, giving him the potential for a nice three-pitch mix.

He flew under the radar a bit because he wasn't selected for many top showcase events last summer, though he did make his presence felt at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October. He has built off that momentum this spring and could factor in the top three rounds. Milone has a sweet right-handed swing and advanced feel for manipulating the barrel. He has added strength and his bat looks quicker this spring, giving him at least average power potential despite a lack of physicality. Most of his pop presently comes to his pull side, and there could be more to come if he adds more muscle and more loft to his stroke. A shortstop in high school, Milone projects best defensively at third base. He has the hands and instincts to stay on the dirt, though he has below-average speed and an average arm with inconsistent accuracy. He does have a good first step, and some scouts would try him at second base while others wonder if he might wind up in left field."

French is the best of this year's class, though he may not go quite as high in June. Part of a powerhouse Parkview High (Lilburn, Ga.) program that has produced big leaguers Jeff Francoeur, Jeff Keppinger, Matt Olson and Clint Sammons, he helped the Panthers win national and Georgia state 7-A titles in 2018. French has the potential to contribute on both sides of the ball. A right-handed hitter, he makes consistent hard contact and uses the entire field. His strength and bat speed create plus raw power and he understands that he doesn't have to swing for the fences to produce home runs. While scouts like French's offense more than his defense, he gets the job done as a catcher. The Clemson recruit has solid arm strength though it plays more as average because he doesn't have a quick exchange. He moves well enough behind the plate and has the hands to become at least an average receiver."

Then he singled and stole a base on the offensive end while throwing a perfect inning on the mound, serving notice that he might be the best two-way player in this Draft class. Scouts won't get the chance to see him this spring, however, as surgery to fix a small fracture in his throwing elbow will put him on the shelf until the summer. The scouting industry is somewhat divided about where the 6-foot-7 left-hander's future lies. On the mound, he's up to 93 mph with his fastball, a pitch that's rarely straight. He has the ingredients of a very good curveball that could eventually be a plus pitch. It all comes from a projectable body and a delivery that works, giving hope that he'll find the strike zone more consistently and have the aptitude to add an effective third pitch as he gains more experience. Many thought he'd turn into a pitcher only, especially given his size, but he's shown he uses all those moving parts well as a position player. He's a plus runner and obviously, his arm works well, and he's played both the outfield and first base. He has a whip of a swing and is very unpolished, but some evaluators can dream on him as a hitter. Jones has as much upside as perhaps anyone in the Draft class and that's true on both sides of the ball. He still could factor in the early rounds of the Draft, though teams looking to sign him away from his Vanderbilt commitment will have to do so based on his summer performance."

He's one of only four players to earn Under Armour All-America honors in baseball and football, joining Kyler Murray, A.J. Brown and Maurice Hampton (another top prep prospect in this class). He has committed to play both sports at Mississippi, and his multisport talents give him added leverage but also cloud his signability -- as does a disappointing spring at the plate. Ealy needs to smooth out his right-handed stroke and has had trouble making quality contact against Mississippi high school pitching as a senior. He also had swing-and-miss issues on the showcase circuit last summer. He has impressive bat speed and packs plenty of strength in his compact frame, giving him at least 20-homer upside if he puts it all together at the plate. Ealy can flash top-of-the-scale run times and already shows a knack for stealing bases. His quickness allows him to chase down balls in both gaps from center field, though his reads and routes need more work, and his strong arm will play anywhere in the outfield. His package of tools is similar to that of Murray, who signed with the A's for $4,660,000 as the No. 9 overall pick in the 2018 Draft before winning the Heisman Trophy and becoming the No. 1 overall choice in the NFL Draft."

After a strong summer and fall on the showcase circuit, Nesbitt's Draft profile took a leap forward and that got bigger schools interested, leading to Nesbitt switching gears to the University of Florida. That, plus a senior season that hasn't been quite as good as his summer, makes his Draft status a bit more of a question mark. The 6-foot-3 right-hander is a projection arm with some stuff to dream on. He was in the low-90s for much of the summer, and his velocity has backed up a bit to more in the 89 mph range this spring, but there is definitely more in the tank. His breaking ball is below-average currently, as it gets slurvy, but has the makings of a decent slider in the future. He hasn't thrown his changeup much, so that's a work in progress, though it showed decent action over the summer. He generally repeats his delivery and throws strikes. Any team interested in Nesbitt is going to have to exhibit patience on the player development side, but knows there could be a future starting pitcher in there to unlock. Whether a team is willing to take him early enough to sign him away from playing for the Gators remains to be seen."

After an up-and-down freshman campaign, Fall has been dominant as a sophomore, moving up the ranks of top junior college talent in the 2019 Draft class. Fall certainly looks the part, with a strong, physical 6-foot-6 frame and a clean arm action and left-handed delivery. He'll be up to 94 mph consistently with his fastball, though not with a ton of deception as hitters can pick the ball up early because of a slightly lower slot. Fall does flash a solid breaking ball, but tends not to get on top of it. He'll try to throw a cutter and a slider as well, but can get caught between them and either needs to stick with the slider because of his arm slot being so far away from his head or raise his slot a little and go with the curveball. The changeup is below-average right now, but there is some feel for it with the hopes of it become a viable option once he starts throwing it more. Fall had originally committed to St. John's before switching to Brookdale, and he would head to Arizona State should the Draft not work out. His left-handedness, plus body and high ceiling could make a team take him early enough to keep him from heading to Tempe."

That's largely because his father, Larry, is the head coach at Cal Poly, and his son has worked out with college teams for some time now. Lee's Draft stock took a big jump over the summer, particularly with his performance at the Area Code Games, and he's continued to be a solid performer this spring. A switch-hitter, Lee has worked hard on getting his right-handed hitting up to the same level as his more natural left side. He doesn't have the prettiest swing in the world -- it's steep and he can come off the ball too quickly -- but his hand-eye coordination is so good that he doesn't swing and miss much, with some seeing a future plus hitter. He can turn around premium velocity with ease and while he doesn't have a ton of power now, there is some strength in his swing. Defensively, Lee has outstanding hands and a strong arm and his instincts allow him to get to balls he shouldn't be able to based on his below-average speed. Because of those skills and his high baseball IQ, Lee will likely get sent out as a shortstop at the start of his pro career, though some see a move to second in the future. Wherever he plays, any team wanting to take Lee will have to make sure they can sign him away from playing for his dad at Cal Poly."
35,10,1047,,188,$0.00,683175,Connor,Phillips,Connor,Allan,2001-05-04,P,MAGNOLIA,Texas,USA,Houston,TX,USA,Magnolia West HS,HS SR,USA,TX,74,190,R,R,Toronto Blue Jays,https://atmlb.com/2WbH5bk,"Louisiana State grabbed two of the better pitching prospects from Texas for its recruiting class, though both Jimmy Lewis (Lake Travis High, Austin) and Phillips began turning their projection into reality this spring and thus may not get to Baton Rouge. Phillips helped Magnolia West win its first-ever district title and breeze through the first three rounds of the state 5-A playoffs, tossing three complete-game victories (including two shutouts) in his first three postseason starts. While Phillips has a pair of potential plus pitches in his fastball and curveball, both still require some work. He operates at 90-94 mph, reaches 96 and holds the velocity on his heater deep into games, but it gets hit harder than it should because batters see the ball well coming out of his long arm action and high slot. He spins his upper-70s curveball with power and depth, though he sometimes struggles to land it in the strike zone. Phillips also needs to refine his changeup, which should happen as he uses it more often against better hitters. He features effort in his delivery and may be able to tone it down a bit without sacrificing the quality of his stuff once he gets stronger."

He limited Marist High (Chicago) and Jason Hodges, the best position prospect among Illinois high schoolers, to one run in five innings in a Wrigley Field showdown in late April. Though Louisville does a good job of holding onto its Chicago-area recruits, his projectability could entice a pro team to buy him away from college. Prosecky works at 89-93 mph with his fastball, compensating for modest life by using his 6-foot-4 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot to create angle and plane. He has plenty of room to add strength and could start reaching the mid-90s regularly once he fills out. He has advanced feel for a changeup, selling it with deceptive arm speed and achieving some fade. After flashing a solid slider on the showcase circuit, Prosecky has seen it become more fringy this spring and has lost some trust in his breaking ball. He has an easy delivery and repeats it well, allowing him to work both sides of the plate. He's reminiscent of Mark Buehrle in the way he works faster than most pitchers while pounding the strike zone."

But he's also the best pitching prospect to come out of Jenks (Okla.) High since Josh Johnson was a Marlins fourth-rounder in 2002, and whichever team drafts him will keep him on the mound. He could go a couple of rounds higher than Johnson did to a club willing to bet on his athleticism and projectability. Osmond has one of the quickest arms in the 2019 prep class, making it easy to dream on his fastball. He works at 92-94 mph early in games and sits more at 88-91 in the later innings for now, but he could have a mid-90s heater once he adds strength to his 6-foot-3 frame. Operating from a high-three-quarters arm slot, he creates more downhill plane than life on his fastball. Osmond's arm angle gives him depth on a low-80s slider that shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch when he doesn't open too early in his delivery. The Oklahoma State recruit has demonstrated feel for a changeup in the bullpen but hasn't had much cause to use it in games. With his athleticism and the ease with which he throws, he pounds the strike zone and could develop at least above-average command."

While Jack Kochanowicz is the top pitcher in the state, Newell and Sammy Siani have battled it out as the top outfielders in the area. While Siani rates higher and has more polish, Newell might beat him in terms of raw tools. At 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds, the left-handed Newell certainly looks the part of an athletic outfielder and has shown glimpses of the tools to match. While unrefined, he does have good raw power with a swing that should allow him to continue to drive the ball. He will need to work on his overall approach and improve his feel for hitting in order to tap into that pop consistently. Newell has good speed that many feel could allow him to stay in center field, with some scouts thinking he has a better shot to stick there than Siani does, though others see a move to left eventually. Newell hasn't always shown the ability to use his raw tools consistently on the field, and there have been some questions about his effort level this spring. That could stem from his desire to sign, as he does have a commitment to attend the University of Virginia should the Draft not work out."

He should go between the third and fifth round, which will be high enough to divert him from a Mississippi commitment. Dunhurst has the potential to make an impact both offensively and defensively. He has cleaned up his work behind the plate and could become a solid receiver if he continues to improve. He loves to catch and has a strong arm to combat basestealers. A left-handed hitter, Dunhurst generates plus raw power with a combination of bat speed and strength. He'll need to prove he can make consistent and quality contact against more advanced pitching.

But he came down with a flexor strain in his forearm and made just two regular-season appearances, clouding his status. He did some bullpen workouts for teams but was shut down as the Draft approached, increasing the likelihood that he follows through on a commitment to Baylor. Rigney has one of the best sliders in the Draft, a sharp low-80s breaker that carved Baty up. He works the bottom of the strike zone with a 90-93 mph fastball that tops out at 95 and features sink and downhill plane. He's physical yet still projectable, so there could be more velocity in his future. Though he doesn't need it often as a high schooler, Rigney also shows the makings of at least an average changeup with some fade. There's some effort in his high-three-quarters delivery that he can smooth out, but that hasn't prevented him from throwing strikes. He has the ingredients to pitch toward the front of a big league rotation if he can stay healthy."

High has produced Ben McDonald, Russ Johnson and Travis Swaggerty, all of whom blossomed into first-round picks after attending college. The Yellow Jackets' latest star is Doughty, who could follow the same path if he makes it to Louisiana State. How much teams buy into his power potential will determine if he goes high enough in the 2019 Draft to divert him from Baton Rouge. Doughty is an advanced hitter for a high schooler, showing nice feel for the barrel while employing a compact, quick right-handed swing. He has a controlled approach that mainly produces line drives but he also has room to add 20 pounds of muscle to his 6-foot-1 frame. Though he presently has below-average pop, he could develop into a 20-homer threat if he gets stronger and more aggressive. Doughty can generate some plus run times but figures to lose a step as he matures physically. His quick hands and plus arm allow him to make plays at shortstop, though he probably will wind up at second or third base as he slows down a bit. Adding more power would help him profile better at a less challenging defensive position."

There are some questions if he'll remain a catcher in the future, but McCormick has improved his pitch receiving and his arm strength."
